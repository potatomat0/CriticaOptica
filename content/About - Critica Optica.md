## Purpose and Scope

This website is intended to function as a:

1. **Quick Reference:** This website functions as a readily accessible reference guide for critical/media/cultural/literary theories. It focuses primarily on the works of thinkers associated with Continental Philosophy.
    
2. **Interactive Visualization:** CriticaOptica goes beyond a simple reference point. It aspires to be an interactive tool that helps users visualize the interconnectedness of various concepts, ideas, and seminal figures within critical theory.

> [!NOTE]
> While CriticaOptica strives to remain neutral in its presentation, it's important to acknowledge a potential inherent bias. Due to the focus on Continental Philosophy, many of the thinkers explored here lean towards Leftist, Anarchist, neo-Marxist, and anti-capitalist ideologies.
