[[Yale School of Deconstruction]]

 A shorthand
way of referring to a moment in the 1970s when the work of [[Derrida, Jacques]] was taken up and
experimented with by four prominent
[[post-structuralism]]
literary critics in the Department of English at Yale: [[de Man, Paul]], [[Miller, J. Hillis]], Geoffrey Hartmann,
and [[Bloom, Harold]]. While
it is true that these authors drew inspiration from Derrida's work,
their brand of
[[deconstruction]] bears very
little resemblance to Derrida's (we could also say, to adapt a phrase
from [[Jameson, Fredric]]---himself
sometimes mistakenly included in this school because he happened to be
at Yale then---that the two versions of deconstruction have much in
common, indeed everything save the essentials). The Yale form of
deconstruction tends to be a highly playful and erudite form of close
reading, with very little interest in making either a philosophical or
political point, whereas Derrida is precisely concerned with the latter.
