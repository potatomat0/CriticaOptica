[[-scapes]]

 A suffix (or word
ending) adapted by [[Appadurai, Arjun]] from the word
'landscape' in his account of what he calls the cultural economy of
[[globalization]]. In
*Modernity at Large* (1996), he proposes that there are five different
-scapes that, taken together, comprise the 'imagined world' (a notion he
adapts from [[Anderson, Benedict]]'s concept of
[[imagined community]]) of
the present as we understand it from a cultural perspective. These are
(i) ethnoscapes (the mobility of people---tourists, workers, migrants,
refugees); (ii) mediascapes (the global media and the representations of
the world they collectively create); (iii) technoscapes (the mobility of
manufacturing); (iv) financescapes (global capital flows); and (v)
ideoscapes (the movement and traction of ideas). In order to think about
the transition or movement within these different -scapes, Appadurai
borrows [[Deleuze, Gilles]]
and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]]'s
concept of
[[deterritorialization]].
