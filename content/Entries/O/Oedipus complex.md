[[Oedipus complex]]

 The central
organizing [[myth]] of
[[psychoanalysis]]. In *Die Traumdeutung* (1900), translated as *The Interpretation of Dreams*
(1913), [[Freud, Anna]] relates
that in his clinical experience the child's relationship to its parents
is the major determinant in the psychical lives of his more neurotic
patients. This idea occurred to him a few years earlier during
self-analysis. As he reports in a letter to his friend Fliess, in
analysing his affection for his mother and jealousy of his father he was
reminded of the Sophocles play *Oedipus Rex* (429 bc), which he thought
could only continue to be so affecting some 2,500 years after it was
written because its thematic concerns are universal. Freud elaborated
this claim on two different levels: the individual subject, and human
society.
The story of the Oedipus myth, on which Sophocles based his play, is as
follows: King Laius of Thebes learns from an oracle his son will kill
him. Thinking to avert this fate, he binds his son's feet (hence his
name, which means swollen feet) and then orders his wife Jocasta to kill
him. Unable to do so she orders a servant to carry out the evil deed,
but instead he abandons the child in the fields where he is discovered
by a shepherd who passes him to a fellow shepherd from Corinth who takes
the infant back to his land where he is raised in the court of King
Polybus. As an adult Oedipus also goes to an oracle and is told that he
will marry his mother and kill his father. Hoping to avoid his fate, he
leaves Corinth, and---as fate would have it---meets his biological
father on the road to Thebes. The two men fall into an argument and
Oedipus duly kills his father. He continues on his way to Thebes. Thebes
is at that time under the spell of the Sphinx, who has cursed the city.
He solves the Sphinx's riddle, thereby lifting the curse, and is
rewarded with the Kingship over the city and the hand of its recently
widowed Queen, namely his biological mother. The prophecy is thus
fulfilled, but at this point none of the characters in the play is aware
of this fact. When at last they learn the truth of what has transpired
Jocasta hangs herself and Oedipus blinds himself and goes into exile.
According to Freud, this myth resonates strongly with everyone because
it tells the basic story of childhood development, at least from the
boy's perspective. Psychoanalysis holds that all children develop a love
attachment to the parent of the opposite sex and a corresponding rivalry
with the parent of the same sex: thus, the little boy loves his mother
and wants to usurp his father. What the story narrates in effect is
[[object]] choice, but it
also teaches compromise, or what Freud called the [[reality principle]]. In 1910 Freud
would describe this conflicted desire as the 'Oedipus complex', thus
inscribing the myth at the centre of his thinking and teaching. This
phrase has since passed into popular usage, which has not always been to
the advantage of psychoanalysis because many people find it absurd or
repugnant (Freud himself defended against such reactions by saying they
just proved his point because the myth would not provoke such outbursts
if it was not revealing an inner truth). At first, Freud thought this
desire had to be literal, but he came to realize it could also be
enacted symbolically. Freud initially confined the period of the
'Oedipus complex' to children under the age of 5, but he later modified
his thinking and allowed that it didn't reach its proper resolution
until puberty.
In 1972, in a work pointedly titled, *L'Anti-Œdipe*, translated as
*Anti-Oedipus* (1977), [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] published a
scathing attack on the centrality of the 'Oedipus complex'.
