[[object relations theory]]

 A
subsection of
[[psychoanalysis]] which
prioritizes the role of the
[[object]] in childhood
development. It is generally associated with the British Psycho-Analytic
Society, whose most notable members included [[Balint, Michael]], [[Klein, Melanie]], and [[Winnicott, Donald Woods]]. In contrast to
traditional psychoanalysis, object relations theory focuses on the
relationship between the infant and the mother, not the father-child, or
[[field]], relationship
that is central to [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s thought. It also
conceives this relationship as subject (child) to object (mother), or
even to part-object (the breast), which again contrasts with Freud who
acknowledges the role of the object but still wants to see the
relationship between child and parent as intersubjective.

[[objet (petit) a]] In
[[Lacan, Jacques]]'s
[[psychoanalysis]], the
[[object]] of
[[desire]] that can never be
obtained. It has a range of meanings in Lacan's work, but the most
consistent and widely recognized understanding of it is that it is that
which desire [[lack]] in
perpetuity and is therefore that which causes desire. In later
formulations, Lacan came to think of it as the surplus value of
enjoyment ([[jouissance]]).
Lacan always insisted that the term remain untranslated so as to give it
an algebraic status in English, and for the most part this is respected.
Literally, it might be rendered as the 'object (little) a', but this is
still not completely right since the 'a' stands for *autre* (other), so
strictly speaking it should be the 'object (little) o'.
