[[over determination]]

 **1.**
The standard English translation of *Überdeterminierung*, the word
[[Freud, Sigmund]] uses to
describe the effect of the
[[dreamwork]] processes known
as [[condensation]]
(*Verdichtung*) and
[[displacement]]
(*Verschiebung*) whereby *either* a number of different dream-thoughts
are compressed beneath a single image *or* the affect of one
particularly strong dream-thought is transferred onto another
comparatively innocuous image. The net result is a multilayered image
that cannot be taken at face value and whose surface is only a partial
and at best unreliable indicator of what lies beneath.
**2.** French Marxist philosopher [[Althusser, Louis]] adapted this
term (it is rendered in French as *surdétermination*) to articulate his
thesis that all social practice is multiply determined, or has more than
one cause, hence its contradictory nature and appearance. A classic
example of what Althusser has in mind can be seen in the debate
concerning climate change---it is the lavish western lifestyle that is
allegedly the cause of the present crisis, yet that is the one thing we
are apparently unwilling to give up in order to resolve the crisis. But
because of our awareness of the crisis and its inherently contradictory
nature we have got used to the perfectly Althusserian idea that every
single aspect of our daily life, from the way we dispose of our garbage
to the products we buy, is *at once* an effect of a larger process we
loosely refer to as
[[globalization]] *and* a
contribution to a larger process we refer to as, again very loosely,
climate change. Our decision to buy Fairtrade or organic products is in
this sense overdetermined because it reflects both personal desire and
an awareness of the economic system as a whole. The crucial implication
here is that a change at one level---our consciousness of the
seriousness of the threat climate change poses to the future of the
planet---does not automatically translate into action on the other
level. We have not given up our consumerist lifestyle; we have merely
tried to alter its modality, as though to say we can save the planet
from the effects of consumption by shopping differently.
