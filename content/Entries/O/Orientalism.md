[[Orientalism]]

 Traditionally,
any form of scholarship or indeed fascination with the Orient, meaning
the countries generally referred to today as the Middle East (but also
encompassing the whole of North Africa, Turkey, Pakistan, and the
northern tip of India). [[Said, Edward]]'s book *Orientalism:
Western Conceptions of the Orient* (1978) transformed the term from a
relatively neutral, though obviously biased, name for a venerable field
of study dating back several hundred years, into an indictment of
bigotry and racism. Said's work emptied Orientalism of its previously
positive associations and connotations and put in their place a long
list of charges. Indeed, there are few critical reversals of the meaning
of terms as complete as Said's demolition of Orientalism. His basic
charge is that the Orient as conceived by the Orientalists (primarily,
but not exclusively, English, French, and German) is a fiction of their
own imagining bearing no resemblance to the actual Orient, which, as
Said points out, is a vastly complicated region. He notes, too, that
many of the most famous Orientalist scholars never even visited the
Orient, relying instead on second-hand accounts of it, as though the
actuality of the Orient did not really interest them. This fictional
Orient conjured up by Orientalists is, Said shows (using the work of
[[Foucault, Michel]] as his
inspiration), a discursive production, a fantastic place that is the
product of hundreds of years of mystification, exoticization, and
outright deception made possible by the discrepant power relations
between West and East. The problem, he argues, is that the West's
ongoing fantasy of the Orient has real effects: insofar as the West
understands the Orient as backward, unenlightened, irrational, sexually
deviant, unhealthy, uninviting, and so on, it forms its politics
accordingly (one has only to recall Donald Rumsfeld's callous disregard
for the looting of Iraq's national museum following the fall of Baghdad
in 2003 to see the consequences of this). In the 30 years since its
publication, *Orientalism*, has become a cornerstone of [[Postcolonial Studies]].

**(defamiliarization or estrangement)** A central concept in [[Russian Formalism]]'s attempt to
describe and define what constitutes
[[literaturnost]]
(literariness). A neologism, it implies two kinds of actions: making
strange, and pushing aside. Consistent with this double meaning, the
concept refers to the techniques writers use to transform ordinary
language into poetic language, which for the Russian Formalists is
language which induces a heightened state of perception. Habit,
according to the Russian Formalists, is the enemy of art, therefore to
produce art the writer has to force the reader outside of the usual
patterns of perception by making the familiar appear strange or
different. The principal theorist of this concept, [[Shklovsky, Viktor]], uses a famous
passage in Tolstoy's *War and Peace* (1869), where an opera is described
as 'painted cardboard and oddly dressed men and women who moved, spoke
and sang strangely in a patch of blazing light' to exemplify this
concept. Basically what Tolstoy does, according to Shklovsky in *Theory of Prose* (1990), is view things out of context, or to put it another
way he fails to see the thing that makes the actions he describes either
meaningful or coherent and in this way he defamiliarizes them. In *The Prison-House of Language* (1972), [[Jameson, Fredric]] enumerates three
advantages of the concept of *ostranenie*: firstly, it enables literary
theory itself to come into being by providing a way of distinguishing
its object---namely, poetic language; secondly, it enables a hierarchy
to be established within works and between works (i.e. more or less
defamiliarizing); thirdly, it generates a new way of thinking literary
history in terms of ruptures and breaks rather than continuities and
influences. The problem with this concept, however, is that it is
psychological rather than purely textual, inasmuch as it is premised on
the deadened senses of the reader being awakened by clever writing
rather than something specific to the writing itself. Obviously, too,
this process suffers from the logic of diminishing returns---what was
shocking yesterday is all too familiar today, thus demanding an ever
greater level of shock to achieve a decreasingly small level of shock
value (this, as many commentators have observed, is the problem
contemporary non-representational art also faces). *See also* [cognitive
