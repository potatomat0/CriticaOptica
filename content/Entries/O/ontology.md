[[ontology]]

 In philosophy, the
theory of the existence of things---at its most basic, or fundamental,
it seeks to answer the question why there is something rather than
nothing. It does not examine the existence of particular things; its
focus is the more general level of the possibility and actuality of
anything existing at all. In the twentieth century, the most influential
account of ontology was given by [[Heidegger, Martin]], in his
extensive writings on the subject.
