[[object]] **(*Objekt*)

** The
thing, which may be a person, body part, symbol, image, or idea, through
which the [[drive]] seeks to
attain its aim, namely its satisfaction or extinction (albeit
temporary). In choosing this term, [[Freud, Sigmund]] wanted to make the
point that the drives (the psychological organization of the instincts)
do not make a distinction between animate and inanimate, partial and
whole, or even real and imagined. The notion of the object is central to
[[psychoanalysis]],
particularly its theory of sexuality. At the most basic level, object
choice defines sexual orientation (whether homosexual or heterosexual);
but it also defines the nature of the sexual perversions (any form of
sexuality not organized around a relationship to another person). Since
object choice is said to occur in childhood, the theory of the object is
particularly important to child psychoanalysts like [[Klein, Melanie]].
Objects can be both internal and external to the body---hunger, for
example, feels as if it is located in the pit of the stomach, so it is
internal; whereas sensation or touch, which is experienced through the
skin, is external. The distinction between the internal and external
object is by no means straightforward, however, because some objects
appear external but only function if they are rendered internal, such as
the thumb which the child sucks in order to go to sleep. Objects can
thus be effective and ineffective and therefore subject to love and
hate, often at the same time, a state that is known in psychoanalysis as
[[ambivalence]].
Klein called the ineffective objects 'bad objects' and the effective
ones 'good objects' and based her theory of child development around the
child's need to learn to deal with the crises the bad objects apparently
represent to them. The classic example of the bad object is the breast
that does not provide milk. Understandably, perhaps, to the hungry child
such an object can be an object of hatred. What should also be observed
is that for the child the breast is not necessarily a part of the object
called 'mummy', and for this reason it is known as a part object. The
theory of how the child relates to a particular object (part or whole)
is known as [[object relations theory]]: it is concerned with
not only the feeling of love or hate towards the object, but also its
placement ([[introjection]] or
[[hyperobject]], i.e. internal
or external), and the way they act on or with the object.
