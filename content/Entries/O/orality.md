[[orality]]

 The state of a
language which has no written form but exists only as spoken words. This
concept was created to try to gauge the effect writing technology has on
a society and more especially on its language. For example, it is
thought that in oral societies the meaning and pronunciation of words
changes more rapidly because it isn't fixed by the standardizing power
of print. By the same token, without the mnemonic power of print oral
societies make greater use of myths and songs as a way of preserving
knowledge. Interestingly, the father of
[[structuralism]], [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]], disputes both these points and argues instead for the priority of speech over writing.

[ordinary language
philosophy](#Xf59989db5a440be49a6d56771594a44ef5321d4) A branch of
philosophy interested in language's capacity for meaning. A product of
the so-called [[linguistic turn]], ordinary language
philosophy treats misunderstanding in philosophy as a failure to
understand language. In contrast to [[analytic philosophy]], it does not
treat with suspicion language's capacity for obfuscation, but sees this
as one of language's many capabilities that philosophy ought to be able
to explain. Its central claim is that meaning resides in use, that words
mean what they are used to mean. The leading figures in this field are
[[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]],
Gilbert Ryle, [[Austin, John Langshaw]], and [[Searle, John Rogers]].
