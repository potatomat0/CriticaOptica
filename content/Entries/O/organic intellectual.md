[[organic intellectual]]

 An
intellectual or someone of professional standing (i.e. a doctor, lawyer,
or priest) who rises to that level from within a social
[[class]] that does not
normally produce intellectuals, and remains connected to that class. In
other words, the organic intellectual is the opposite of a yuppie---they
are not upwardly mobile and their concern is for the conditions of their
class as a whole, not for themselves. Italian
[[Marxism]] philosopher
[[Gramsci, Antonio]] develops
this concept in his famous *Prison Notebooks*.
