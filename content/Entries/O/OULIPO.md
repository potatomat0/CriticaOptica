[[OULIPO]]

 A small group of
novelists and mathematicians founded in France by Raymond Queneau and
François Le Lionnais for the purpose of exploring the creative
interaction between the respective fields. The group's name is an
acronym derived from the very
[[’pataphysics]] sounding
*OUvroir de LIttérature POtentielle* (workshop on potential literature),
a fact that was surely not accidental given that many of its members
were also involved in the Collège de 'pataphysique, of which it is in
fact an offshoot. Although the group itself has never had a particularly
high profile, a number of its members have---the most prominent are
undoubtedly Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec, and [[Calvino, Italo]]. The group used
mathematical formulae to create what Perec referred to as writing
machines. So for example the writers might adopt the constraint that
they cannot use a certain letter, or they might write following the rule
that each successive word in a sentence must be a letter longer than the
previous word and so on.
