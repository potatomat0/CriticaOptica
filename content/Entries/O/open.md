[[open]]

 and closed work
Italian semiotician and novelist [[Eco, Umberto]] proposed this binary
in his 1959 essay 'L'opera in movimento e la coscienza dell'epoca',
translated as 'The poetics of the open work', to describe works of art
that, on the one hand, appear incomplete inasmuch as they appear to be
given to the audience to make of them what they will, and on the other
hand, seem finished and somehow unassailable, as though the audience's
input was neither desired not needed. He refers to the former as open
and the latter as closed and equates the first with freedom and the
second with obedience and submission. Eco is aware that all texts, to a
certain degree, can be regarded as co-productions between author and
addressee, but he shows that what is at stake is in fact an issue of the
world view of a text, or what [[Foucault, Michel]] would later term
the [[episteme]]. He gives
examples of medieval allegories and argues that in their own time, no
reader would have thought it possible not to read them for their
Christian message. It is only now, in a secular age, that such a reading
is possible.
[[Opoyaz]] Russian acronym
created from *Obschevesto po izucheniyu poeticheskogo yazyka* (Society
for the Study of Poetic Language), which along with the [[Moscow Linguistic Circle]] was one of
the precursor groups to [[Russian Formalism]]. The group was
formed in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1916, by a group of students and
professors working in language studies. It was chaired by the poet Osip
Brik and its membership included [[Shklovsky, Viktor]], Boris
Eichenbaum, and [[Jakobson, Roman]]. The group was
interested in uncovering the working mechanisms of literary technique,
or more precisely identifying the specific quality of language use that
separated the literary text from the non-literary text. The group, never
more than a loosely knit discussion unit and occasional cooperative
publishing venture, folded in 1923 and merged with the Moscow Linguistic
Circle, though by then many of its leading lights had already fled
abroad.
