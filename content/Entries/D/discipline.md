[[discipline]] 

[[Foucault, Michel]] 's concept to
describe a broad scale movement he detected in European history away
from spectacular and grotesque forms of punishment towards more subtle
modes of coercion that take the individual body as their target.
Commencing in the mid- to late eighteenth century, at the start of the
era that Foucault would later characterize as the age of
[[biopower]], techniques were
developed in a number of quarters---particularly the armed services---to
harness more fully the potentiality of the human body. These new
training techniques were distinguished by the fact that they no longer
looked upon the body as an indissociable whole, but instead treated it
as an interconnected series of parts that could be thought of as so many
components of a machine. By means of a meticulous training of the body,
its productive capacity could be enhanced and at the same time its will
to resist reduced, the attraction of this outcome to the holders of
power is obvious. What Foucault shows is that this new logic of
discipline, which first took shape in the preparation of soldiers, found
application in virtually every aspect of modern life.

prison* (1975), translated as Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the
Prison (1977).
