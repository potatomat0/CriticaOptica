[[dialectic]]

 A method of
argument based on the idea of two people in dialogue each putting
forward a proposition that the other counters and by this means arriving
at an ultimate truth. The word originates in Classical Greek
philosophy---its invention is sometimes attributed to Zeno, but it was
Socrates and Plato who popularized it as a means of obtaining truth by a
process of asking questions. German
[[Enlightenment]]
philosopher, [[Kant, Immanuel]] rejected this method
as sterile, as producing nothing but illusions. In contemporary critical
theory, however, it is the names [[Frege, Gottlob]] and [[Marx, Karl]] which are most often
associated with the dialectic, each one credited with having reinvented
the concept. Central to Hegel's notion of the dialectic is the constant
presence of contradiction: as Hegel points out, identity contains its
opposite, namely difference, inasmuch that to be one thing something
must also not be another thing. His best known demonstration of this
argument is his essay on the relation between the master and the slave
in *Ph√§nomenologie des Geistes* (1807), translated as *Phenomenology of
Spirit* (1977), in which he famously argues that because the master is
conscious of the need to dominate the slave he is enslaved and therefore
not fully himself. For Hegel, history can be understood in the same
terms as a constant progression from the abstract to the concrete,
mediated by a process he referred to as negation. To become a true
master, the master must negate that part of himself which is enslaved,
but in doing so he does not thereby become whole; on the contrary, he
merely becomes deficient in a different way, so the negation itself must
be negated. Hegel called this process *Aufhebung* which in German means
the superseding, surpassing, and cancelling out of what was. It is
generally translated into English as sublation, but this isn't wholly
satisfactory. Marx felt that Hegel got things around the wrong way and
described his own version of dialectics, also known as [[dialectical materialism]], as a standing
of Hegel back on his feet. His complaint was that Hegel treated the real
world as merely the phenomenal form of the idea, whereas for him it is
the real world that gives rise to ideas. However, like Hegel, Marx gives
a central role to contradiction, which in its empirical form of [[class struggle]] is the motor of
history. Marx wanted to show that capitalism is simultaneously the best
and the worst thing that has happened in human history and that it is
only by grasping its dual nature that it can truly be understood. In
Marx's view, capitalism created tremendous productive capacity, enabling
necessity to finally be conquered, but did so at the price of the
monstrous exploitation of the many by the few. Marx saw his dialectical
method as a 'scandal to the bourgeoisie' because implicit in it is the
view that its recognition of the present state of affairs is also a
foretelling of its inevitable destruction. In his development of
[[dialectical criticism]],
Jameson insists that this sense of scandal must be preserved.
