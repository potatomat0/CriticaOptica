[[diaspora]]

 Derived from the
Greek for 'scattering of seeds', it is used to describe population
migration and dispersal (voluntary and involuntary). Originally used to
refer to the Jewish peoples' forced exile from Israel (as it is now
known) in the pre-Christian era and their subsequent removals from
Spain, Portugal, and Russia, where they had resided for well over a
thousand years, diaspora is now used to refer to virtually any mass
migration. Slavery in Europe and the Americas resulted in an African
diaspora, whereby millions of Africans were forcibly relocated to
distant lands. Similarly, European colonialism resulted in millions of
Europeans relocating to far-off continents. This in turn led to Indian
and Chinese diasporas as cheap labour was imported to South Africa,
Australia, Fiji and elsewhere to solve various production problems.
Diaspora is generally thought in terms of 'homelessness', a sense of
trauma and exile, but lately it has come to be viewed more positively as
a kind of post-national
[[cosmopolitanism]] or
[[Creoleness]] in which the
diasporic subject represents a new, more advanced stage of politically
and culturally heterogeneous citizenry. *See also*
