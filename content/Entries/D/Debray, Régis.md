[[Debray, Régis]]
 (1940--)


French left-wing intellectual, journalist, academic, and policy adviser
who became internationally renowned (if not infamous) for his links to
Fidel Castro and Che Guevara as well as for his advocacy of guerrilla
warfare. Born in Paris, he studied at two of that city's most
prestigious schools, the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the École Normale
Supérieure, where he worked with
[[Marxism]] philosopher
[[Althusser, Louis]]. Debray
visited Cuba in 1961 to report on its highly successful literacy
campaign and became interested in Latin American politics. He returned
there in 1963 and 1964 to study guerrilla tactics and subsequently took
a position at the University of Havana in 1966. Based on his
experiences, he wrote *Révolution dans la révolution* (1967), translated
as *Revolution in the Revolution* (1967), which became a kind of
revolutionaries' handbook, a status that was surely helped to a very
great extent by the fact its Cuban publishers printed 200,000 copies on
its first print run. In 1967 he accompanied Guevara on his last fateful
trip to Bolivia, as a correspondent for a Mexican newspaper, and was
himself captured and imprisoned on the charge of aiding insurrection.
After an international campaign for clemency, led by such prominent
figures as [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]], André Malraux, and
President de Gaulle, he was released in 1970. He then moved to Chile,
taking the opportunity to conduct interviews with its Marxist President
Salvador Allende, which he published as *The Chilean Revolution* (1971).
Following the coup by Pinochet in 1973, Debray returned to Paris. From
1981 to 1995 he worked as a policy adviser to President Mitterrand on
Foreign Affairs, later reporting that the President ignored his ideas.
Over the last two decades he has also developed himself as a media
theorist, completing doctorates at the University of Paris and the
Sorbonne. He has also written a three-volume autobiography, *Le temps
d'apprendre à vivre* (1992--2000).
