[[dreamwork]]
**(*Traumarbeit*)** The process which, according to [[Freud, Sigmund]], transforms
dream-thoughts ([[latent content]]) into actual dreams
([[latent content]]) by
distorting them in such a way that the implicit desires the
dream-thoughts contain do not become apparent to the conscious. There
are two separate functions in a dream---the first is to produce
dream-thoughts, which are created from bodily stimuli,
[[instinct]], and what Freud
called the day's residues (i.e. the many threads of psychic activity
that are left unresolved at the end of the day); the second is the
transformation of those dream-thoughts (many of which are unacceptable
to the conscious), into dream images. This process, the dreamwork
proper, consists of four different mechanisms:
[[condensation]]
(*Verdichtung*),
[[displacement]]
(*Verschiebung*), consideration of representability (*Rücksicht auf
Darstellbarkeit*), and secondary revision (*sekundäre Bearbeitung*).
Dreams are not creative, Freud maintains, they are transformative, and
it is the transformations inherent in them that are crucial from the
perspective of analysis. In other words, in analysing a dream Freud
doesn't ask what a particular image stands for; rather, he wants to know
why the thing it does stand for had to be represented in that way.
