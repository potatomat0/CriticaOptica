[[drive]] 

(*Trieb*)
A
compulsion to act originating in the
[[psyche]] which does not
have a specific [[object]].
In contrast to the
[[instinct]], it cannot be
satisfied. Although there is considerable dispute about it in
[[psychoanalysis]], it is
clear that in his work
[[Freud, Anna]] maintained a clear
distinction between instincts and the drive. Unfortunately, this
distinction was obliterated in English at least by James Strachey's
unhappy decision to translate both *Instinkt* and *Trieb* as drive. The
drive differs markedly from instinct in that it is variable in both
formation and action, but more particularly because its aim is its
object. Take for example, the nutrition instinct (one of the seven basic
instincts according to
[[ethology]]), its aim is to
provide sustenance for the body and its object is food. When we eat we
satisfy that instinct. So why do some of us have such difficulties with
eating---either we eat too much, or don't eat enough? The answer is that
eating is not purely a matter of instinct; there is another dimension to
it which needs to be thought in terms of
[[desire]], which is the
drive. Understood as a drive, the nutrition instinct becomes a kind of
oral drive for which eating is something that is enjoyable in itself,
the object is no longer food it is the mouth itself, but it is not a
proper object in that it does not extinguish the drive or provide
satisfaction. Now there is no aim except the joy of eating. The paradox
of the drive, as its keenest theorist [[Lacan, Jacques]] tirelessly argued,
is that it is driven by what it cannot have; it is, in other words,
motivated by lack. What it lacks is precisely an object that could give
it satisfaction. Freud argued that there were two basic types of drive,
which he called the life-drive (Eros) and the
[[death-drive]] (Thanatos),
that exist side by side in a state of equilibrium. Pathological symptoms
emerge, according to Freud, when these drives fall into a state of
disequilibrium.
