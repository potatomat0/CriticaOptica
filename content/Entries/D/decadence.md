[[decadence]]

 A word used to
express a generalized form of
[[anxiety]] about a decline
in cultural standards. It has been in use in Europe since the Middle
Ages, but the fear of declining standards it names can be traced back to
ancient times. Plato, for instance, wrote that men in earlier times were
better and nearer to the gods than present-day men. As such, decadence
often manifests itself as the 'dark' underside of myths of golden ages,
the representation of past eras as somehow better than the present
moment, and always carries with it a certain anguish that such great
times will never be seen again. This example points to one of the key
characteristics of decadence, namely the tendency to position the
present as inferior to the past and combine that with an urgent call for
a restoration of those better days. One saw a striking example of this
in Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign slogan 'Make America Great
Again'.
Decadence as an aesthetic first crystallized in the latter part of the
nineteenth century in Europe. In the first instance decadence was, in
spite of its subject matter, which tends to recall ancient myths and
supernatural tales, a kind of
[[avant-garde]], or
[[modernism]] inasmuch as it
marked a break with the established aesthetic of its own time. Indeed,
in his book on postmodernism, [[Jameson, Fredric]] describes
decadence as a kind of premonition. The first use of the word
'decadence' in this aesthetic and, more importantly, approving sense
occurred in Théophile Gautier's 1868 preface to Charles Baudelaire's
collection of poems *Les Fleurs du mal* (1857). However the work that
has come to be regarded as the quintessential example of decadence is
Joris-Karl Huysman's *À Rebours* (1884), translated as *Against Nature*
(1926), which interestingly enough is also regarded as one of the more
important examples of naturalism. A veritable encyclopedia of decadent
taste, ranging from literature to cuisine, *À Rebours* is simultaneously
a rejection of romanticism and anti-romanticism, thus creating a
paradoxical space in which something radically new could emerge. Despite
its frequently pessimistic tone, the author maintained that it was a
hopeful work.
Decadence was also a crucial concern for [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]], although in his
case it was something that philosophy had to figure out how to overcome.
He depicts decadence as a form of self-deception and an ever-present
danger; as such it cannot ever be eradicated. One must instead learn to
learn from it as one learns about health from the experience of
sickness. Its most important effect is the confusion it creates between
cause and effect---consequences are made to appear as causes by
decadence. Wagner's operas were, for Nietzsche, the perfect embodiment
of this way of thinking about decadence.
