[[discourse]]

 A specific form
of language use shaped and determined by situational rules and context.
Discourse can be thought of as the performance of language, but even
this is too limiting because the concept is used in place of language
precisely as a way of encompassing the extra-linguistic dimension of all
forms of communication. In [[critical theory]], it is [[Foucault, Michel]] who has done the
most to develop this concept. In his work, discourse is expanded to
include the operation of power: Foucault asks who has the right to use a
particular discourse, what benefits accrue to them for using it, how is
its usage policed, and where does it derive its
[[authority]] from? His
examples include medical discourse (including psychiatry), penal
discourse, and sexual discourse.
