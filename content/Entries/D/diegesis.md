[[diegesis]]

 The opposite of
[[mimesis]], according to
Plato. In diegesis the author speaks in their own voice, whereas in
mimesis they do not (instead they try to create the illusion that it is
someone else who speaks). In the 1960s, French
[[structuralism]] scholars
like [[Metz, Christian]] and
[[Genette, Gérard]] adapted it
to refer to the actual succession of events in a story---i.e. what
happens---which they opposed to the narration or telling of the story
(effectively the new form of mimesis). This distinction found two
particular uses in literary and film studies. First it allowed the
separation of narrators who participate in the story which they are
telling and those who do not---think of Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*
(1900): Marlow participated in the action of the story he tells, so he
is a diegetic narrator; but the person he tells the story to, who is in
fact the one who reports to us as readers does not, therefore he is
extra-diegetic, that is, outside of the story. Similarly, music in film
can be either diegetic or extra-diegetic, part of the story being told,
or an aural backdrop.
[[différance]] French
philosopher [[Derrida, Jacques]]'s term---he
explicitly rules out calling it a concept---for the condition of
possibility for meaning. As he explains in the extremely helpful
collection of interviews, *Positions* (1972), translated as *Positions*
(1981), Derrida conceived this neologism in order to make apparent the
way in which the French verb *différer* has both a temporal and a
spatial dimension: on the one hand, it signals delay or reprieve (a
deferred payment such as a pension, or a pre-recorded broadcast of a TV
programme may both be referred to in this way); and on the other hand,
it is the movement which separates like from unlike. To which Derrida
adds a third observation to the effect that *différance* is the process
which gives rise to the very differences it announces. As such,
*différance* is an origin one never arrives at (its presence is
permanently delayed), a difference one never fully succeeds in making,
and the perpetual and necessary attempt to do both these things. The
term is difficult to translate because the first of the three senses is
not available in the English cognate 'to differ', making it hard for
Anglophones to 'hear' its inner complexity. But if one bears in mind
that it refers to a condition of possibility rather than a particular
form of causality or even effect then its purpose can be understood
relatively easily. In the interview already mentioned, Derrida goes on
to discuss the notion of transgression in a way that illuminates quite
helpfully what he is endeavouring to articulate with this notion of
*différance*: transgression, he says, can never be achieved once and for
all, because insofar as a law is transgressed it proves itself
transgressible and by that measure the act itself ceases to be a
transgression; so transgression must move ceaselessly to restore the
integrity of the law it wishes to transgress. For this reason, as
[[Lacan, Jacques]] and other
[[psychoanalysis]] have
pointed out, the supposedly arch-transgressor, namely the Marquis de
Sade, is also of necessity an enthusiast of the law. Derrida's reading
strategy, which he calls
[[deconstruction]], assumes
that *différance* underpins every aspect of meaning-making.
