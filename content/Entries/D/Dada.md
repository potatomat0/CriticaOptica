[[Dada]]

 Artistic movement
(encompassing literature, the performing and visuals arts) formed in
response to World War I and the imperialist bourgeois culture that
fomented and prosecuted the war. Volatile and short-lived, it flourished
in Europe and America from about 1916 until roughly 1924. It paved the
way to [[Surrealism]] and is
often lumped together with Surrealism, but in fact its aesthetic was
distinctive, as the
[[Situationism]] would
insist in the 1950s and 1960s.
If [[Breton, André]] is
Surrealism's pope, then the pope of Dadaism would have to be Hugo Ball.
His Cabaret Voltaire, which opened in 1916 in the Spiegelgasse in
Zurich, is generally thought of as the birthplace of the movement. Its
denizens included Tristan Tzara, Hans Arp, Richard Huelsenbeck, and Hans
Richter. Ball coined the name Dada, the title of the movement's
magazine. As Ball explained it, Dada is 'yes yes' in Romanian, 'rocking
horse' in French, a sign of naivety in German, and the first words out
of a baby's mouth. It simultaneously stands for everything and nothing,
which was Dada's aesthetic in a nutshell.
Dada aimed to produce a form of art that functioned as anti-art, as art
that put to the sword the decadent pretensions of pre-war art. Its
anti-art was also intended to make a social statement. Its signature
look is that of the 'ready-made', an ordinary object such as a urinal,
re-contextualized and transformed into art, and the 'collage' or 'cut
up', ordinary items juxtaposed in forceful and creative ways so as to
produce art.
The movement was as peripatetic as its members. Just as the very word
Dada has several meanings, so there are several Dadas. In New York, at
almost the same time as the events in the Cabaret Voltaire, expatriate
French artists Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia were making a
sensation at the famous 'Armory Show' with what Duchamp called
anti-retinal art, i.e. art designed to stimulate rather than please the
eye. In his account of
[[postmodern]] art as that
which brings forth the unpresentable, Jean-François Lyotard singles out
Duchamp as one of the key artistic precursors to the postmodern
aesthetic.
Besides New York and Zurich Dada, there are at least two other forms of
Dada usually recognized: Berlin Dada and Paris Dada. Unlike New York and
Zurich, Paris and Berlin were not neutral cities; the war was being
fought literally on their doorsteps. Consequently Berlin and Paris Dada
were bleaker than their predecessors. George Grosz's blood-soaked
*Homage to Oskar Panizza* (1917--18) perhaps best typifies this changed
outlook. Berlin Dada also invented the technique known as photomontage
(the best known exponent is undoubtedly Man Ray), which influences
[[avant-garde]] arts still.
Paris Dada was the product of Duchamp and Picabia, who returned from New
York in 1919 and connected with Tzara and a vibrant group of young
intellectuals and artists like Paul Éluard who were determined to defy
convention and produce something radically new.
Dada didn't really end so much as implode. The group couldn't sustain so
many fractious personalities and fell apart. But the ideas and
techniques it pioneered continue to exert an effect today.
