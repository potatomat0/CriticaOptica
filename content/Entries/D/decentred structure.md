[[decentred structure]]

 French
[[Marxism]] [[Althusser, Louis]]'s term for
[[Marxism]]'s conception of the
social totality as opposed to
[[genre]]'s. In Althusser's
view, Hegel's structure of the whole is expressive, meaning that each
part of the whole is capable of expressing or representing the
whole---so, for example, the economy can be used to describe the state
of society as a whole. Althusser rejected the idea that one part can
stand for the whole and instead argued that every part is mutually
dependent on every other part (a relationship he described as
semi-autonomous).
