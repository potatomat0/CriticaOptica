[[dialectical materialism]]

 The
official name given to
[[Marxism]] philosophy,
although it is not a phrase that [[Marx, Karl]] himself used. Current
from the time of the Second International onwards, it was the official
[[ideology]] of the USSR,
where (under Stalin's direction) the vast body of work by Marx and his
followers was codified and transformed into a set of laws that went by
the appropriately imposing name of *Diamat*. Stalin himself contributed
to this task with a book of his own, *Dialectical and Historical
Materialism* (1938), although it has to be said that there are serious
doubts as to whether he actually authored the work himself. Dialectical
materialism combines the dialectical approach of [[Frege, Gottlob]] with the
philosophical materialism of Ludwig Feuerbach (one of the so-called
'Young Hegelians'). Following Feuerbach, who attempted to create a
secular version of Hegel's dialectic of spirit, Marx repudiated Hegel's
idealism, claiming in a famous phrase that in doing so he had stood
Hegel back on his feet, and prioritized matter over spirit. At its core,
dialectical materialism is of the view that the world exists
independently of our perception of it and that as it is the sole reality
it has primacy over the ideal, the imagined, and the spiritual.
Moreover, as [[Engels, Friedrich]] insisted, the world
is characterized by constant revolutionary changes driven by its own
internal contradictions. Engels codified his view as three laws, drawn
from classical philosophical sources as well as Hegel: first, the world
consists of opposites that are simultaneously in state of conflict and
unity (e.g. night and day); second, quantitative changes give rise to
qualitative 'leaps' (e.g. the boiling of water, when the temperature
passes 100°C---which is a quantity---it turns into steam---a change in
its quality); third, change is a process of negation (e.g. a seed
germinates into a plant, and in doing so negates its previous existence
as a seed, and in turn negates that state of negation by becoming a
plant, and so on). Dialectical materialism has been criticized, both
from within Marxism and without, for being overly dogmatic and rather
too programmatic in its approach. [[Habermas, Jürgen]] critiques it for
being a scientism, for mistaking a philosophy for a science in other
words; meanwhile, [[Althusser, Louis]] lauds it
precisely because in his view it transforms philosophy into science.
