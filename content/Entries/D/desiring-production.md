[[desiring-production]]

 The
term used by [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] in *L'Anti-Œdipe*
(1972), translated as *Anti-Œdipus* (1977), for the process of
[[desire]]. In spite of the
title of their book, Deleuze and Guattari are not
anti-[[psychoanalysis]]---as
they put it, their goal is to renovate psychoanalysis by re-engineering
its principal conceptual mechanisms. From this perspective then,
desiring-production may be seen to replace the
[[Freud, Anna]] concept of the
[[id]] and thereby render the
[[instinct]] productive.
Similarly, it also replaces the
[[anaclisis]] conception of
[[lack]] as the principal
motor of desire with the notion that desire is a productive, assembling
force. But they also use the notion of desiring-production to infuse
some [[Marxism]] into
psychoanalysis and argue that
[[society]] could not
function as it does if desire was not the synthesizing force it is.
Borrowing from Kant, Deleuze and Guattari develop a kind of ethics of
desire by distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate syntheses
of desire.
