[[desire]]

 One of the
fundamental powers of reason according to [[Kant, Immanuel]], which is able to
exercise its judgement without the mediation of
[[pleasure]]. In [[critical theory]] desire and pleasure
are usually opposed to one another---desire is treated as a continuous
flow, while pleasure is treated as an arrest of that flow, or an
irruption that somehow brings desire to an end. For this reason desire
is often categorized as sacred, while pleasure is consigned to the
profane. There are two different debates concerning desire. The first is
whether desire is cognitive or
[[instinct]], or to put it
another way, voluntary or involuntary. The second is whether desire is
self-motivating or not. The general consensus, with regard to the first
question, is that desire belongs to the instincts, it is a force that
flows through us which we have to learn to channel and contain in order
to become 'civilized'. There are two vehemently opposed camps with
regard to the second question: on the one side there is [[Lacan, Jacques]], who argues that
desire is motivated by
[[lack]] (that it constantly
flows toward an [[object]] it
cannot obtain), while in the other camp is [[Deleuze, Gilles]], who, rather like
Kant, treats desire as one of the basic forces of nature itself.
