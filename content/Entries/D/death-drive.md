[[death-drive]]
(***Todestrieb***) The tendency inherent in all organic things to return
to an inorganic state. The concept is part of a dualism developed late
in [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s career
consisting of two forces the life-drive (*Lebenstrieb*) and the
death-drive, also known as Eros and Thanatos after the Greek Gods for
love and death respectively, which exist in a state of equilibrium (for
this reason Freud sometimes referred to it as the 'Nirvana principle').
According to Freud, the death-drive manifests in the
[[psyche]] as a tendency
toward self-destruction, or more precisely the elimination of tension,
which can also be turned outwards, whereby it becomes aggression. The
idea of the death-drive originates, to some degree, with the concept of
the [[compulsion to repeat]],
which refers to behaviour which cannot be explained by the concept of
the [[pleasure principle]].
For example, it does not give us pleasure to dwell on a humiliating
incident and yet very often we cannot seem to get it out of our head, we
keep going over and over it. This being so, Freud reasoned there must be
another drive at work besides Eros. Similarly, Freud could not conceive
that [[ambivalence]], or
aggression, or melancholia could be derived from the pleasure principle
either. The death-drive is a highly contested concept in
[[psychoanalysis]] and there
is no agreement as to its coherence or cogency. [[Lacan, Jacques]] maintains the
concept of the death-drive within his own schematization of the drives,
but renders it part of every drive, thus undoing Freud's dualistic
conception of it. [[Deleuze, Gilles]] rejects it out of
hand as ridiculous, while [[Žižek, Slavoj]] shows in countless
works that it is a very useful concept for thinking through many of the
inanities of [[consumer society]]. The death-drive,
which Žižek visualizes as a kind of zombie-drive, is used to explain the
empty satisfaction of consumerism, the fact that no matter how much we
buy it never extinguishes the urge to buy more.
