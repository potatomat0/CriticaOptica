[[decolonization]]

 The
historical process whereby countries under colonial rule by foreign
(usually European) powers transitioned to self-rule. The term is very
broad in its sweep and encompasses both a vast geographical territory
(the majority of the global South or former [[Third World]]) and a complicated
timeline (it didn't take place all at once), but also significant
differences in how it was achieved (violent or peaceful) as well as
divergent outcomes (relative prosperity and crushing poverty).
Decolonization began in the immediate aftermath of World War II, in part
because European powers like Britain and France were no longer capable
of holding on to their empires, but also because (in the case of India
at least) independence had been promised in return for assistance during
the war. But as the Vietnam War demonstrates, the colonial empires were
not always given up without a fight. And as often as not it led to
bloody wars, sometimes with the colonial power, but just as frequently
internal civil wars erupted in the wake of the departing colonial power
as factions fought to control the newly decolonized nation's future. Not
all decolonizing nations decolonized to the same extent, indeed in many
cases the nations endeavoured to preserve the basic civic structure the
colonial powers had created but with all the key positions of government
placed into indigenous hands. The Ghanaian independence leader Kwame
Nkrumah designated this kind of change in government without change in
the way government is conceived
[[neocolonialism]].
Decolonization is a foundational moment for [[Postcolonial Studies]]. It brings together
a variety of questions, too, about nationalism, national identity,
[[nativism]], and the
[[transcultural]].
