[[discursive formation]]

 French
historian [[Foucault, Michel]]'s term for a
system of [[statement]]
produced by force of a single [[discursive practice]] (the underpinning
system of rules of a particular society at a certain moment in its
history). Foucault created this concept as a means of rethinking
causality in a nonlinear or dispersed fashion. For instance he wanted to
be able to show that transformations which took place in such diverse
and geographically dispersed entities as factories, hospitals, prisons,
and schools in Europe throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries were consistent with one another, because there is a
discursive link connecting them all. The changes are not the product of
a single consciousness, or a specific intention. The changes accrue over
time as a specific discursive practice---in this case
[[discipline]]---moves more
and more into the foreground. Discursive formations emerge, then, in a
slow and uncertain way; they aren't born or created by fiat; and they
are anonymous and objective.
