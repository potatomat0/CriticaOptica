[[discursive practice]]

 French
historian [[Foucault, Michel]]'s term for the
system of rules governing the production of
[[statement]] in a
particular society at a certain moment in history. These rules are
anonymous, unintended and objective; they are not simply the laws or
social regulations either. They are rather the rules for the production
of statements, determining not merely what can and cannot be said at one
moment, but also---and more importantly---what it is possible to say. To
be able to say someone is 'mad' for instance requires that madness exist
as a concept and that the rules for its use are established. It is the
production of these rules that interested Foucault as a historian.
