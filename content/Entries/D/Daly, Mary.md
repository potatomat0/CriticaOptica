[[Daly, Mary]] 
(1928--2010)


American [[radical feminism]]
philosopher and theologian. Daly was born in Schenectady in New York
State. She obtained two doctorates---one in philosophy and one in
theology---and taught for more than 30 years at the Jesuit-run Boston
College (she was eventually forced into retirement because of her
refusal to teach male students, which ran foul of College policy). A
provocative figure in the feminist movement, Daly is best known for
*Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism* (1978), which argues
that western culture reduces women to object status and that this, in
turn, destroys women both mentally and physically. She argues that
western society is not merely patriarchal in its organization, but that
reality itself (by which she means, language, experience, and
consciousness) is patriarchal and that feminism cannot succeed unless it
addresses this basic fact. A highly influential figure, Daly has been
criticized from within the feminist movement, particularly by Audre
Lorde, for her failure to appreciate the unequal way oppression is
distributed according to differences in race and class.
[[Dasein]] German philosopher
[[Heidegger, Martin]]'s word
for the individual
[[subject]]. Produced from
two words in German 'Da' and 'sein' which separately mean 'there' and
'being' but together are usually translated as 'existence', *Dasein* is
usually left untranslated and the most literal reading of it is the one
that is recommended. In other words, *Dasein* is not the same as the
subject, but replaces it in Heidegger's philosophy with the precise aim
of eliminating from his thinking all the baggage and presuppositions
associated with the notion of the subject. Only by making this break in
our thinking are we able to understand the subject in its being as a
subject, which is first of all a matter of *Dasein*.
