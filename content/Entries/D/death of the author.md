[[death of the author]]

 Taken
from the title of an essay by [[Barthes, Roland]], 'La mort de
l'auteur' (1968), translated as 'The Death of the Author' (1977), this
phrase is widely regarded in academia and the media as emblematic of
both [[post-structuralism]]
and [[postmodernism]] in that
its purpose is to signal the absolute relativity of the text and the
correspondingly enhanced status of the critic. Put simply, Barthes's
basic point is that the author's life (the intricate details of their
biography, in other words) is not part of the literary object. Although
Barthes makes no mention of it, his argument echoes and extends the work
of W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley who, in two famous essays 'The
Intentional Fallacy' (1946) and 'The Affective Fallacy' (1946) (both
appear in revised form in Wimsatt's *Verbal Icon* (1954), argued that
neither our knowledge about an author nor the particular affect a piece
has on its readers are valid grounds for judging the quality of the
text. Barthes's point differs in that, in contrast to these two
forerunners of [[New Criticism]], he is not
interested in judging the relative merits of certain literary objects,
but is rather trying to unravel the specific ontology of the literary
object. His argument has three strands to it, each one reflecting the
influence of ideas that were in circulation at the time of writing,
though not yet synthesized as they are here: first, when an author
creates a character and gives that character a voice the author ceases
to be the one who is speaking (this point echoes [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]]'s notion of
[[dialogism]]); second, all
writing is simply words on a page, so it is language itself that speaks
not an author (this is a fundamental premise of
[[structuralism]]); third,
all writing is quotation (this point echoes [[Kristeva, Julia]]'s notion of
[[intertextuality]]). *See also* [readerly and
