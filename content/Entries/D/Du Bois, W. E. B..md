[[Du Bois, W. E. B.]]
(1868--1963) Founding figure of black [[Cultural Studies]], writer,
sociologist, economist and activist, of whom it has been said he
attempted virtually everything possible to overcome western racism short
of armed insurrection. Born in Massachusetts, a descendant of Haitian
slaves, he was raised by his mother after his father deserted the
family. Although very poor, Du Bois nonetheless had access to excellent
education and excelled in school. He studied at Harvard and the
University of Berlin. He wrote over 4,000 articles in his lifetime, but
most of these pieces (many of which are minor editorial essays written
while he was editor of *Crisis*, the organ of the
[[ANT]]
National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People), of which he was a
co-founder) are hard to find and astonishingly there is no collection of
his works. Undoubtedly his most famous work, though, is *Souls of Black
Folk* (1903), which a century on is still widely studied and taught. An
advocate of assimilation and integration (but on a level playing field)
Du Bois disagreed profoundly with Marcus Garvey's separatist strategies.
Black people have to endure a double-consciousness, Du Bois argued, in
that they have to know when and how to act 'white' as well as 'black'.
Thus, they live conscious of the fact that to some 'they' are a problem.
Paul Gilroy, in his *The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double
Consciousness* (1993), argues that this thesis can be extended to the
black [[diaspora]] as a
whole.
