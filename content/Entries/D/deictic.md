[[deictic]]

 Any of an important
class of words whose meaning can only be fully determined by context.
Also known as a [[shifter]]
([[Jakobson, Roman]]'s
preferred choice), a deictic is a word like the pronouns 'I' or 'you'
whose meaning varies according to context because their principal
function is indicative rather than semantic. Their role is of particular
interest in literary and critical studies because of the complexities of
their use in reported speech.
