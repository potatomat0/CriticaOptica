[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]
[[Adorno, Theodor]] and [[Horkheimer, Max]]'s modification
of [[Kant, Immanuel]]'s thesis
that [[Enlightenment]] means
the end of the intellectual immaturity of humans and the advent of the
Age of Reason. Adorno and Horkheimer accept that the Enlightenment did
bring about the Age of Reason, but argue that reason is a double-edge
sword, or in their words a
[[dialectic]], because as
humankind exercises its reason and transforms its environment according
to its own needs it also allows an 'instrumental' way of thinking to
dominate every aspect of thought with the paradoxical result that
rational ways of thinking give rise to irrational acts. Written during
World War II, *Dialektik der Aufkl√§rung* (1944), translated as *The Dialectic of Enlightenment* (1972), is primarily concerned to understand
how a country like Germany, so rich in its intellectual tradition, could
have succumbed to the atavistic appeal of Nazism. Their answer, in part,
was that thought had been allowed to become a mere commodity, something
to be exchanged, rather than something that influences life.
