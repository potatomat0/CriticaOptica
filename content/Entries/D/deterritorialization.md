[[deterritorialization]]
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]]'s concept for
[[desire]] that operates in
an unorganized (not to say disorganized) way, by which they mean a mode
of desiring that does not require an
[[object]] to motivate it and
give it direction. In *L'Anti-Œdipe* (1972) translated as *Anti-Oedipus*
(1977), Deleuze and Guattari redefine [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s concept of the
[[drive]] as a territory, so
to deterritorialize means to sever desire from its connection to the
drive. But they also argue that desire is constantly looking to
reterritorialize, to restore its connection to the drive in other words.
Deterritorialization is an optimal process for Deleuze and Guattari,
necessary to the release of creative energies. However, at its extreme
deterritorialization is synonymous with schizophrenic psychoses, and in
their later work Deleuze and Guattari are careful to state that one must
exercise caution in deterritorializing. But, they nevertheless hold to
the idea that at least a little bit of deterritorialization is needed to
stop things from stagnating. *See also*
