[[desublimation]] 

[[Marcuse, Herbert]] 's term for the
process whereby art (in the strictest sense) is rendered banal and
powerless. In *One-Dimensional Man* (1964), his million-selling account
of the changes to society wrought by [[late capitalism]], Marcuse argues
that the real problem posed by the [[culture industry]] for [[critical theory]] and hence
[[society]] itself is not its
blurring of the distinction between high culture and low culture, but
rather its blurring of the distinction between art and reality.
Consistent with fellow [[Frankfurt School]] theorists [[Horkheimer, Max]] and [[Adorno, Theodor]] (the authors of the
culture industry thesis) and more particularly [[Benjamin, Walter]]'s account of art
in the age of mechanical reproduction, Marcuse argues that the mass
production and distribution of art and its concomitant permeation of
almost every aspect of daily life has destroyed what was most potent in
art to begin with, namely its antagonism toward the ordinary (Benjamin's
word for this is [[aura]]).
This antagonism is achieved via the process
[[Freud, Anna]] called
[[sublimation]], which
according to
[[psychoanalysis]] is what
happens when the [[libido]]
is brought under the control of the [[reality principle]]: gratification of
sexual desire is delayed and transformed into an aesthetic achievement
or what Marcuse refers to as Eros. Under such conditions, Marcuse
argues, the artistic realm is an 'other' dimension, radically distinct
from and intrinsically antagonistic to [[everyday life]], and society can
therefore be said to be two-dimensional at least. It is the loss of this
dimension through the process of desublimation whereby Eros is reduced
to sexuality that results in society becoming one-dimensional and
therefore unable to resist the transformations imposed upon it by the
changes in the [[mode of production]]. Where before in
art and literature representations of artists, prostitutes, adulterers,
and so forth testified to an other, perhaps
[[utopia]], life, now they
are simply an affirmation of the existing order and carry no power of
negation. Desublimation is in this sense repressive. So-called sexual
liberation, Marcuse argues, comes at the price of the destruction of
Eros, which leaves us with an intensified sexual existence but no
resistance to the present, no space that can be considered 'other'.
