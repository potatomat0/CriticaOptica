[[de Man, Paul]] 
(1919--83)


Belgian literary theorist and leading figure in the [[Yale School of Deconstruction]]. Although his
work is associated with
[[deconstruction]] it had its
own well-formed character, established long before he met [[Derrida, Jacques]]. De Man was
principally interested in
[[allegory]], i.e. any mode
of literary writing that can be seen to function on more than one level
at a time. De Man's essential hypothesis is that all texts consistently
exceed both the author's and the reader's attempts to state what their
meaning is. This is because the very process of trying to state a text's
meaning creates the conditions for producing still further meaning. Thus
a text cannot close off the possibility of finding meaning in it,
including meanings that are not only unintended by the author but
antithetical to the author.
De Man's work can be read as journey from [[New Criticism]] to
[[post-structuralism]] that
took off from the wrong platform and never quite arrived at its
destination. It never fully repudiates the former and never fully
embraces the latter. In contrast to New Criticism, de Man's subject
matter tends to be not only European (rather than American) in origin
and ranging across a broader spectrum of languages, time periods, and
histories, but also more philosophical than strictly literary-critical
in intent. For better or worse his name is most closely associated with
that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, about whom he wrote several important
essays (see in particular *Allegories of Reading* (1979)), including one
written in response to Derrida's reading of Rousseau (see *Blindness and
Insight* (1971)). De Man was particularly interested in the 'blindness'
inherent in previous interpretations of Rousseau, by which he means the
strange way literal readings of Rousseau are privileged over figural
readings despite the fact that it is generally agreed that the most
basic elements of Rousseau's thinking, such as his concept of the 'state
of nature', are in fact fictions.
The concept of 'blindness', which came to be attached to de Man's name,
was brought full circle when, three and half years after his death, a
trove of some 200 pieces de Man wrote during World War Two for the
Nazi-controlled Belgian newspapers *Le Soir* and *Het Vlaamsche Land*
was uncovered by Ortwin de Graef, then a PhD student at the University
of Leuven. To the shock of many, his work was overtly anti-Semitic and
openly pro-Nazi. Derrida, himself a Jew, wrote a long piece bravely
trying to defend de Man's wartime writing (*Memoires for Paul de Man*
(1986)), but despite his heroic efforts the shadow of collaboration
continues to hang heavily over de Man. [[Jameson, Fredric]] also defends de
Man in *Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism*
(1991), arguing, reasonably enough, that most of de Man's critics lack
experience of war and cannot know the choices one might be forced to
make under such circumstances.
