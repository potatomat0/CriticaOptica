[[displacement]]
(***Verschiebung***) One of four key mechanisms of [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s concept of
[[dreamwork]]. It is also to
be found at work in the symptom-formation of both
[[neurosis]] and
[[hysteria]]. The concept of
displacement depends on the prior thesis, developed by Freud, that a
representation (*Vorstellung*) of an
[[instinct]] one makes to
oneself and its [[affect]]
(*Affekt*) or [[liminality]]
charge are effectively semi-autonomous. The
[[shifter]] is a classic
instance of this: to someone with a foot fetish, for example, the image
of a naked foot has the same affect as does the image of a naked body as
a whole (indeed, if they were a true fetishist in the clinical sense,
the foot alone would give pleasure). Similarly, advertising constantly
uses this strategy, aiming to shift the libidinal charge of sexual
imagery onto products in the hope that the idea of that product will
have a libidinal affect too. In dreams, the displacements tend to be
found in the apparently irrelevant details of the dream which seem to
occupy a place of undue prominence---they become apparent in therapy
when in discussing them patients have a disproportionate reaction to
them (i.e. the affect of their response is greater than the apparent
affect of the idea). In *Die Traumdeutung* (1900), translated as *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1953) Freud gives the example of a dream in
which someone sees themselves climbing up a staircase, an activity that
at first glance seems relatively insignificant; but on closer
examination, he argues that its true significance is that the person
concerned was worried about the dangers of sexual relations with someone
of lower social class. The Russian linguist [[Jakobson, Roman]] has argued that
displacement is in fact a form of
[[metonym]] and as such one
of the fundamental poles of language. [[Lacan, Jacques]] adopts this thesis
in his work, arguing that
[[desire]] is in its nature
metonymic.
[[dispositif]]
(**apparatus**) An organization of
[[statement]] and things.
The term is used by [[Foucault, Michel]] in his work on
[[governmentality]] to
describe the non-systemic connection of heterogeneous statements that
exists in a contemporary formation such as the law which combines the
discourse of law along with the architecture of courthouses, the
costuming of judges and lawyers, as well as the administrative measures
required to maintain it all. It is for this reason often translated as
'apparatus', although this does not really work as it is a virtual
process rather than an actual entity. As Agamben writes in his succinct
account of the concept, *What is an Apparatus?* (2009), the *dispositif*
has three key attributes: (1) it is a heterogeneous network of objects
of practically any type (linguistic, nonlinguistic, physical, virtual,
etc.); (2) it always has a concrete strategic function and is always
located in a power relation (as is obvious in the example given of the
law); and (3) it sits at the intersection of relations of power and
relations of knowledge. *See also*
