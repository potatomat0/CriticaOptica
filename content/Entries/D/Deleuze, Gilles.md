[[Deleuze, Gilles]] 
(1925--95)


Undoubtedly one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth
century, the century his friend [[Foucault, Michel]] mischievously
suggested would be named after him. Deleuze's work became the height of
fashion in the early part of the twenty-first century, spawning
literally hundreds of books about his work. Although notoriously
difficult to read and often frustratingly elusive, Deleuze has broad
appeal as a thinker because his work invites creative application not
slavish adherence.
Born in Paris, Deleuze studied for his *baccalauréat* at the Lycée
Carnot and then his *khâgne* at the Lycée Henri-IV. From there he went
to the Sorbonne to study philosophy, graduating in 1948. His classmates
included François Châtelet, [[Lyotard, Jean-François]], Michel Butor,
[[Klossowski, Pierre]], Claude
Lanzmann, maker of the epic film *Shoah* (1985), and the novelist Michel
Tournier, who remembers Deleuze in his memoir, *Le Vent Paraclet*
(1977), translated as *The Wind Spirit* (1988). His first book,
*Empirisme et subjectivité. Essai sur la nature humaine selon Hume*
(1953), translated as *Empiricism and Subjectivity: An Essay on Hume's
Theory of Human Nature* (1991), was written while he was still a
student. What is interesting about this, besides the obvious fact
Deleuze was a prodigy, is that in later life Deleuze repudiated
everything else he wrote in this period. In his own eyes then, his work
on Hume marks the true starting point of his career.
As is customary in the French academic system, Deleuze then did his time
in the Lycée system, first in Amiens, then Orléans, and finally back in
Paris, for nearly a decade before obtaining a post as a junior lecturer
at the Sorbonne in 1957. He remained there until 1964, when he moved to
the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. In 1962, after an
eight-year publishing furlough, Deleuze published his second book,
*Nietzsche et la philosophie*, translated as *Nietzsche and Philosophy*
(1983), which many regard as his most important. It is credited with
sparking a profound 'return to
[[cathexis]]' after more
than half a century of neglect because it overturned the gloomy image of
Nietzsche as the ultimate nihilist and dismissed the suspicions of those
who bought the distorted picture of him as a Nazi philosopher created by
his sister Elisabeth. Instead it presented Nietzsche as a philosopher of
joy, calling on us to overcome our
[[ressentiment]] and
embrace life fully, that is to say in an
[[active]] rather than
reactive manner.
This theme would remain constant throughout Deleuze's work, although the
terms themselves would disappear by the end of the 1960s, evolving into
what many see as a
[[vitalism]] philosophy. His
next books explore this problematic, somewhat obliquely it has to be
said, through an examination of literature. Inspired by Nietzsche's idea
that the philosopher is a kind of physician, Deleuze looked to the work
of Proust and Sacher-Masoch to see whether this idea applied to
literature as well. *Proust et les signes* (1964), translated as *Proust and Signs* (1972), and *Presentation de Sacher-Masoch* (1967),
translated as *Coldness and Cruelty* (1971), inaugurate a trajectory in
Deleuze's work he named the 'clinical' that culminated in the
publication of *Critique et clinique* (1993), translated as *Essays Critical and Clinical* (1997). In between the books on Proust and
Sacher-Masoch, Deleuze wrote on commission textbooks on Bergson and
Kant. The former is generally taken as evidence that Deleuze was indeed
a vitalist, while the latter is read as a sign that Deleuze's
philosophical project consisted in completing Kant's critique---this is
made explicit in Deleuze's later collaborative works.
From 1964 until 1969 Deleuze taught philosophy at the University of
Lyon, during which time he prepared the requisite two theses for his
Doctorat d'État, both of which appeared in the watershed year of 1968:
*Différence et répétition*, translated as *Difference and Repetition*
(1994), and *Spinoza et le problème de l'expression*, translated as
*Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza* (1990). By his own account,
*Difference and Repetition* was the first book in which he did *his own*
philosophy, the first book in which he broke away from writing the
history of philosophy and began to create new philosophy for himself.
Written in the same period, though not published until a year later,
*Logique du sens* (1969), translated as *The Logic of Sense* (1990),
ostensibly a study of Lewis Carroll's work, but really a profound
meditation the philosophy of language, completes this phase of Deleuze's
career.
Deleuze did not participate in the events of [[May ’68]] and was generally
ambivalent about its results. On the one hand, he was impressed by the
fact that such a large number of people, some 10 million students and
blue collar workers, had coordinated their action to show their dissent,
but on the other hand he detected fascist elements in the operations of
some of the groups. In the summer of 1969, a young psychoanalyst and
political activist by the name of [[Guattari, Félix]] sought Deleuze
out because he admired his work and it proved to be a meeting of true
minds. Now Deleuze knew how to respond philosophically to May '68. He
and Guattari agreed to work together and over the next several months
they met and shared ideas and developed a work that was simultaneously a
critique and a rethinking of both
[[Marxism]] and
[[Freud, Anna]] (particularly the
[[anaclisis]] interpretation
of the latter) and a synthesis of a new methodology they proposed to
call [[schizoanalysis]], the
core concept of which is the
[[desiring-machine]].
Guattari's notebooks, *Écrits pour l'Anti-Œedipe* (2005), translated as
*The Anti-Œdipus Papers* (2006), provide a partial but nonetheless
illuminating picture of how they worked. On its publication in 1972,
*L'Anti-Oedipe*, translated as *Anti-Oedipus* (1977), was an immediate
sensation, but it divided opinion quite sharply between those like
[[Jameson, Fredric]] who
heralded it as a radical intervention and those like [[Anderson, Perry]] who dismissed it
as irrationalist nonsense.
Deleuze spent the remainder of the decade developing his collaborative
project with Guattari. The next instalment was an attempt to apply
schizoanalysis to literature focusing on one of their mutually favourite
authors, the great Czech writer Franz Kafka. As the title suggests,
*Kafka: Pour une literature mineure* (1975), translated as *Kafka:
Towards a Minor Literature* (1986), introduced a new category of
literature and a new way of thinking about minority. Minor literature
has become an important concept in [[Postcolonial Studies]]. Perhaps recognizing
the difficulty of his work, Deleuze next published a collection of
conversations or exchanges (he refused to use the word interview) with
his friend Claire Parnet, *Dialogues* (1977), translated as *Dialogues*
(1987), which like the previous book served as an appetizer for the
sequel to *Anti-Oedipus*, which finally appeared in 1980. An even more
prodigious synthesis of new concepts and new ideas, *Mille Plateaux*
(1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987), is arguably one of
the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century. The
outpouring of ideas it initiated continues to fascinate scholars today
and has given rise to a veritable industry of exegetical works seeking
to explain the meaning of such suggestive concepts as abstract machine,
[[assemblage]], becoming,
[[body without organs]],
[[nomadology]],
[[rhizome]], and [[war machine]].
After *A Thousand Plateaus* Deleuze said he needed to find himself again
and his next works were in some ways quite personal. First he wrote a
short book on the art of Francis Bacon, *Francis Bacon, logique de la
sensation* (1981), translated as *Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation*
(2003), this book makes use of some of the concepts developed in *A Thousand Plateaus*, but places more emphasis on new terms like
[[affect]] and sensation,
which would be important to his fourth collaborative work with Guattari,
*Qu'est-ce que la philosohie?* (1991), translated as *What is
Philosophy?* (1994). He followed this with two volumes on film,
*Cinéma 1. L'Image-mouvement* (1983), translated as *Cinema 1: The
Movement-Image* (1986) and *Cinéma 2. L'Image-temps* (1985), translated
as *Cinema 2: The Time-Image* (1989). The books proposed not a
philosophy of film, but rather to articulate the specifically
philosophical dimension of film. Anglo-American film studies was very
slow to appreciate these books, but has in the last couple of years
become deeply fascinated by the way they reorient the discussion of
film.
His next two books were monographs on authors that were close to him
personally and intellectually. The most personal of all these books in
this period was the one he wrote about his friend Foucault, published
two years after the latter's death: *Foucault* (1986), translated as
*Foucault* (1988). His next book was on Leibniz, an author not often
mentioned in the rest of his work yet clearly important to him. *Le Pli:
Leibniz et le baroque* (1988), translated as *The Fold: Leibniz and the
Baroque* (1993) has been well received by creative artists and
geographers who see in it a radically new way of thinking about space
and spatial relations. By the end of the 1980s, Deleuze's health had
deteriorated dramatically and he found it difficult to work, yet he
continued to produce new works, the already mentioned collaboration with
Guattari as well as the essays on the clinical approach to literature.
But perhaps his most important work in these years was the magnificent
eight-hour video of him in conversation with Claire Parnet,
*L'Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze*.
He took his own life in November 1995. It is difficult to classify
Deleuze's achievement. He saw himself as overturning Plato and creating
a form of transcendental empiricist philosophy that took philosophy past
the various impasses it had got itself into. How successful he was in
this venture is still being decided. But it is widely agreed that he was
one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century.
