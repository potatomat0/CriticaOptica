[[dialogism]]

 A principle or
condition of interconnecting performative differences underpinning all
forms of communication according to [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]]. We cannot
understand how meaning is produced, Bakhtin argues, unless we grasp that
the meaning of individual words is the result of a negotiation, not only
between actual speakers in dialogue with one another, but also with
language itself. All language users shift and reshape the meaning of
words according to the demands of their situation. Dialogism is, in this
sense, an extra-linguistic function inasmuch as it is not intrinsic to
words or any of the other parts of speech, yet it is also the sphere
where language *lives* (as Bakhtin puts it) so it cannot be separated
out and treated as surplus to linguistics. It is always possible,
however, for language to sink back into a monologic state, such as one
finds in official discourse. So it is the task of literature, Bakhtin
says, to strive to produce dialogism at every level by orienting it
towards another's discourse with the aim of creating what he calls
double-voiced discourse. Hence his interest in the
[[carnivalesque]], which by
its very nature is doubly-determined: it juxtaposes the official order
of things with its subversive transgression. For Bakhtin, the pinnacle
of this type of writing is arrived at when the author's own voice
disappears and the characters appear to be autonomous, as though
speaking for themselves. Bakhtin first conceived of the concept of
dialogism in his book on Dostoevesky, whom he considered a master of
this form of writing. *See also*
