[[Debord, Guy]] 
(1931--94)


French Marxist, activist, film-maker, social commentator and
philosopher. Born in Paris, he was raised by his mother and grandmother
in the southern resort towns of Nice, Pau, and Cannes. In Pau, situated
in the foothills of the Pyrenees, Debord studied at the same lycée as
his future hero the Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse), author of
*Chants de Maldoror* (1868) and *Poésies* (1870) from which
[[Situationism]]'s watchword
that plagiarism is necessary was lifted. Shortly after the war, he moved
back to Paris, ostensibly to study law at the University of Paris,
though he never took study seriously, preferring instead a Bohemian
life.
In 1951, at a film festival in Cannes he met Isidore Isou, Romanian
eccentric and founder of the Lettrist International movement. Debord
joined the movement and quickly asserted himself as one of its most
inspired proponents. At first, the movement found sustenance in
[[Surrealism]]'s channelling
of the unconscious, but in a pattern that was to be replayed again and
again in Debord's life this was soon rejected in favour of
[[Dada]]'s polemical
lampooning of established values. The movement founded its own journal
*Potlatch*, named after the Native Americans' feast discussed by Marcel
Mauss in his influential work *Essai sur le don* (1925), translated as
*The Gift* (1954). Debord's first film produced in 1952, *Hurlements en
faveur de Sade* (Howlings in Favour of Sade), was a Lettrist exercise in
anti-cinema.
Lettrism ended without a bang and barely a whimper in 1957 at a meeting
with the remnants of the Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus (led by Asger
Jorn, who had also been involved in
[[COBRA]]) at a remote
Italian village. There, 'in a state of semi-drunkenness', as Debord
would later famously put it,
[[Situationism]] was formed
with a show of hands by five votes to one. The idea of the situation,
which was to be the focus of the group's artistic and political
activities, was the product of a commingling of two antithetical
sources: [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s concept of the
situation and his rival [[Lefebvre, Henri]]'s demand for the
transfiguration of the everyday. Lefebvre, with whom Debord formed a
short-lived but intense friendship, was probably the most important
living influence on Debord. Not only in terms of ideas, but also in
terms of contacts: it was through Lefebvre that Debord met the two other
key figures of Situationism, [[Vaneigem, Raoul]] and Constant
Nieuwenhuys.
Debord's name will forever be associated with Situationism, in spite of
the fact that the group dissolved in 1972 amidst bitter, factionalist
infighting, much of it provoked by Debord himself, who had a talent for
the caustic put-down. Not the least reason for this is the fact that the
concepts or practices of
[[détournement]]
(turnaround/reversal) and
[[dérive]] (drift), which
they invented as a means of protesting against what they saw as the
encroachments of capitalism upon the authenticity of life, continue to
be mobilized by cultural activists today. Culturejamming and adbusting
are perfect examples of *détournement*. Similarly, Situationism's notion
of [[psychogeography]], an
experimental procedure for mapping the city from the perspective of
desire rather than habit and obedience to design, still has its
enthusiasts among cultural geographers some 50 years after it was first
mooted.
Debord's most influential work was *La Société du spectacle* (1967),
translated as *Society of the Spectacle* (1970), which made the famous
prophecy that postmodernity seems to have realized in full, namely that
the final form of the commodity would be the image. By no means prolific
in his output, preferring a dense aphoristic style to the sprawling
ramble of his older friend Lefebvre, Debord's total output is
comparatively meagre in volume but exceptional in its impact. Debord's
films are available on DVD and, appropriately enough, on the internet in
bootleg form. A small band of diligent fans have performed Herculean
labours to collect, edit and in most cases translate into English the
bulk of his writings, including his correspondence (four volumes) and
make most of them freely available on the Internet as he undoubtedly
would have wished.
Suffering the painful effects of a lifelong abuse of alcohol, Debord
took his own life with a bullet to the heart in his cottage in Champot.
