[[Derrida, Jacques]]
(1930--2004) French philosopher and one of the most influential
intellectuals of the twentieth century, Derrida is best known as the
originator of
[[deconstruction]]. A
prodigious talent and prolific author, Derrida is generally regarded
(not uncontroversially, it has to be said) as one of the most important
philosophers of all time. Certainly if notoriety can be used as a
measure, there can be no doubting his importance. Yet unlike his peers
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[Foucault, Michel]], his
influence is largely confined (with notable exceptions, of course) to
literature departments and the handful of philosophy departments
admitting the possibility of a 'continental philosophy'.
Born in Algeria, Derrida began his preparation for university at a lycée
there but his education was interrupted because of the restrictions on
Jews imposed by the Vichy government. He moved to Paris in 1949, where
he attended the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand before entering the
École Normale Supérieure (where his tutors included [[Althusser, Louis]] and Michel
Foucault). On his second attempt, he passed his agrégation in 1956.
Between 1957 and 1959, in lieu of military service, Derrida taught
English and French at a lycée in Le Mans. He returned to Paris in 1960
to a position as an assistant lecturer at the Sorbonne. In 1964 he was
given a full lectureship at his alma mater, the École Normale
Supérieure, and remained there until 1983, when he was made Directeur
d'études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. From 1966
onwards, Derrida held regular visiting appointments at Johns Hopkins
University, Yale, SUNY Buffalo, and the University of California at
Irvine.
Derrida rose to international fame on the strength of a talk he gave in
1966 at a conference in Baltimore criticizing [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]], 'La
structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discourse sciences humaines',
translated as 'Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of Human
Sciences' (1978), which is generally credited as the founding moment of
[[post-structuralism]]. The
following year, a watershed year for Derrida, saw the publication of
three books, each one destined to become a landmark in the field, *La Voix et la Phénomène* (1967), translated as *Speech and Phenomena*
(1973), *L'Écriture et la différence* (1967), translated as *Writing and
Difference* (1978), and *De la Grammatologie* (1967) translated as *Of Grammatology* (1976), the last of them containing the instantly infamous
phrase by which Derrida's thought would become known: 'il n'y a pas de
hors-texte' (there is nothing outside the text). Read by his detractors
as evidence of his nihilism, it is generally thought to mean that there
is no higher authority that can be appealed to in order to decide the
meaning of a text.
As Derrida helpfully explains in the useful collection of interviews,
*Positions* (1972), translated as *Positions* (1981), these three
works---*Voix et la Phénomène*, *L'Écriture et la différence*, and *De la Grammatologie* (1967)---announced at once a project (the critique of
[[logocentrism]]) and a
method (deconstruction). By logocentrism he means the idealism of
language philosophy which always assumes that both speech and writing
can only be thought by presupposing an exterior and abstract form of
language he designates as logos. Although the word deconstruction has
passed into popular parlance, its meaning is both more complex and
subtle than its various appropriations have tended to present.
Simplifying a great deal, it can usefully be understood as a practice of
reading interested in articulating the operative elements of a text,
concept, or idea in their full complexity, paying particular attention
to the peculiar paradoxes of mutual interdependencies. For example, in
his late work on the notion of 'forgiveness' Derrida argues that it is
only the unforgivable that can truly be forgiven because it is only the
unforgivable that meets the demand of that which can be forgiven, his
point being that if something can be forgiven that forgiveness is in a
sense given in advance and therefore not really in need of forgiveness,
which by rights should only be given after the fact.
At the core of deconstruction is Derrida's notion---he explicitly says
it isn't a concept---of
[[différance]], which is at
once the means of doing deconstruction and an example of it. In a widely
read essay, entitled simply '*Différance*?' (1968), Derrida explains
that the term is spelled the way it is to bring together two senses of
the verb to differ, which as Derrida reads it means both to defer and to
identify the different. This he explains is the basic condition of the
[[sign]]---the sign stands
for a thing that is absent, so in a sense it defers contact with that
thing; by the same token, the sign is by definition different from that
which it signifies. *Différance* is the origin of difference itself, but
inasmuch as the very notion renders problematic the very idea of an
origin (as Derrida points out) it is better thought of as a condition or
state of affairs that manifests itself as 'play', a word Derrida uses in
its full range of senses from the ludic to the performative to the
architectural. *Différance* has been enormously influential in literary
studies, where it has been used to license a microscopic or 'playful'
form of close reading that to the uninitiated can seem quite laboured.
The best known exponents of this are the members of the so-called
[[Yale School of Deconstruction]].
But it also has to be said that Derrida made his name with a combative
'take-no-prisoners' style of argumentation from which not even his
friends were spared, as Michel Foucault (the first of Derrida's many
scalps) discovered in 1963 when his former student presented an
excoriating critique of his *Folie et déraison* in a public lecture
Foucault himself attended. Other notable scalps include [[Geneva School]], who got into a
spirited debate with Derrida over [[speech act]] theory. Sometimes, as
was the case with his book-length eulogy for his friend Paul de Man,
*Mémoires, pour Paul de Man* (1988), his combative style could be turned
to defensive purposes as well. Probably his most consequential work in
this latter respect is *Spectres de Marx* (1993), translated as
*Spectres of Marx* (1994), which, as [[Jameson, Fredric]] argued in his
review of it, functioned both to renew and more importantly
re-legitimate critical interest in Marx in France and elsewhere. It also
offered a stirring riposte to [[Fukuyama, Francis]]'s celebration of
neoliberalism. In the last decade of his life, Derrida turned
increasingly to political questions, endeavouring to map out an ethics
of hospitality he called
[[cosmopolitanism]].
