[[deconstruction]]

 A reading
strategy developed by French philosopher [[Derrida, Jacques]] whose essential
gesture is to demonstrate that every philosophical position,
irrespective of how coherent it seems on the surface, contains within it
the means of its own self-undermining. Adapting the word from [[Heidegger, Martin]]'s terms
'*Destruktion*' (destruction) and '*Abbau*' (unbuilding), Derrida
himself describes it as a double gesture---the first move consists in
reversing the hierarchy of a particular philosophical opposition, while
the second move amounts to a displacement of the very system in which
the hierarchy operates. Derrida's work is often described as a critique
of the philosophy of presence because he destabilizes the opposition
between presence and absence, particularly with regard to the
[[sign]], which as Derrida
explains in his account of
[[diff√©rance]] is always
the present mark of an absence. Thus, as Jonathon Culler explains in his
seminal account of Derrida's thought and its influence, *On Deconstruction* (1982), it undermines both the philosophy it asserts and
the hierarchical oppositions upon which it relies. As a reading
strategy, deconstruction is particularly interested in identifying those
aspects of a concept or text whose peculiar state of being is to be
undecided, neither this thing nor that thing and not nothing either. His
main example of this is the sign: the sign *as* sign is a sign of
something else, thus it is most fully itself when it is perceived as
something else, but to remain a sign it must also continue to be
perceived as different from the thing it represents.
