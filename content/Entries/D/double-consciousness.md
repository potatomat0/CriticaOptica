[[double-consciousness]]

 A
concept conceived by [[Du Bois, W. E. B.]] in his landmark work
*Souls of Black Folk* (1903) to describe the mental situation of
African-American people in early twentieth-century America. Du Bois
argued that the exclusion of black Americans from mainstream American
life meant that black people not only had consciousness of themselves as
black, they also had consciousness of themselves as not-white as well.
