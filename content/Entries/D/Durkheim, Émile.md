[[Durkheim, Émile]]
(1858--1917) French sociologist, widely considered one of the founders
of the field of sociology. He was born in the Lorraine region of France
into a family of devout Jews (his father, grandfather, and
great-grandfather were all rabbis). Although expected to follow the
family tradition and go to rabbinical school, Durkheim instead studied
at the prestigious college, the École Normale Supérieure (his classmates
included [[Bergson, Henri]]
and Jean Jaurès). He determined to take a scientific approach to the
study of society, which put him at odds with the humanist establishment
and made his career progression difficult as a consequence. He obtained
a post at the University of Bordeaux in 1887 and for the next 15 years
this was his base from which to launch his assault on the French
academic system and begin the work of establishing sociology as a
discipline. His PhD dissertation, *The Division of Labour in Society*
was published in 1893 and was shortly followed by *Rules of Sociological
Method* (1895), which became a manifesto for the fledgling field. In
1898 he founded the journal, *L'Année Sociologique*, which, with
interruptions for war, continues to be published today. The first of the
two books for which Durkheim is best known, *Suicide*, was published in
1897. Comparing the suicide rates of Protestants and Catholics, he tried
to explain why it was lower for Catholics than for Protestants in terms
of social control mechanisms. His data gathering methods have since been
challenged, but the work remains an important early example of a
sociological case analysis because of the way it classifies suicide
types into categories. Having served his time in the provinces, as
virtually all French academics are expected to do, in 1902 he was
offered a position as chair of education at the Sorbonne. The second of
his two famous books, which also happened to be his last, *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life* was published in 1912, the same year
in which he finally obtained a tenured chair at the Sorbonne. In
contrast to his contemporaries, [[Weber, Max]] and [[Tönnies, Ferdinand]], Durkheim's focus
was not the individual, but rather the large scale institutions whose
existence cannot be thought of in terms of the actions of individuals
such as government, religion, and education. He was concerned to explain
how society holds together in the face of
[[modernity]], which for him
meant a social situation not defined by the assumption of a common
background.
