[[desiring-machine]]

 The actual
mechanism of [[desire]]
according to [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]]. Deleuze and
Guattari give as their example the machine formed by the child and the
maternal breast. The idea seems to derive in part from a reaction to
[[Klein, Melanie]]'s overly
[[field]] theory of
[[object]] relations
(particularly her case study of Richard), but more directly from [[Bettelheim, Bruno]]'s case study of
a schizophrenic boy, little Joey, in *The Empty Fortress* (1967).
Looking at these case studies of how children play, Deleuze and Guattari
argue that the objects that the children play with are not
[[symbolic]] (e.g. they
aren't representatives of the
[[phallus]]), but machinic,
meaning they give desire the means to not merely express itself, but
form something constructive. It is in light of this they would later
describe their work as
[[constructivism]]. The
concept first appears in *L'Anti-Oedipe* (1972) translated as
*Anti-Oedipus* (1977), but interestingly is dropped thereafter. In the
sequel to *Anti-Oedipus*, *Mille Plateaux* (1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987), they instead speak of abstract machines and
assemblages, but they retain the core idea that desire's basic function
is to assemble and render machinic.
