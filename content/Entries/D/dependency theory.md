[[dependency theory]]

 An
attempt to explain the persistent poverty of the [[Third World]] as a symptom of the
global system of capital, which in its very structure seems to require
an impoverished global South as a source of cheap labour and raw
materials. Developed by Paul Baran (among others) in the 1960s and 1970s
from a [[Marxism]]
perspective, dependency theory challenges the neoliberal notion that
Third World poverty is simply a matter of underdevelopment, which is to
say in time and with the right entrepreneurial spirit it will catch up
with the First World. It argues instead that the impoverished state of
the Third World is the result of deliberate policies on the part of
First World nations, dating back to colonial times. Britain's deliberate
destruction of India's nascent textiles industry and forced
transformation of that country into an exporter of raw cotton and
importer of cloth at the start of the Industrial Revolution is often
held up as a textbook example of the way the Third World is in fact the
creation of the First World. As Mike Davis points out in *Late Victorian
Holocausts* (2002), at the time this was occurring, Indian peasants
actually had a better standard of living than did British peasants, but
Britain used its disproportionately greater military and economic power
to its advantage and in the process created conditions that many of its
former colonies still struggle to overcome to this day. Dependency
theory scholars like André Gunder Frank and [[Wallerstein, Immanuel]] reject the
concept of [[globalization]]
because in their view capitalism has always been global in scale and
scope. *See also* [[world-system theory]].

[[dérive]] (**drift**) An
experimental technique of walking or moving through the urban space in a
manner contrary to its design yet consistent with one's own desire,
devised by the
[[Situationism]]. Its
purpose is twofold: on the one hand, it is meant to expose a particular
city's [[psychogeography]];
on the other hand, it is a deliberate attempt to break away from what
the Situationists deplored as ordinary life. Owing an obvious debt to
the [[Surrealism]] practice
of aimlessly strolling through the city so as to experience it
unconsciously, but highly critical of its dependence on automatism
*dérive* does not involve surrendering one's will in this way, nor is it
interested in chance or the happenstance. Instead its purpose is to
notice and become aware of the way different parts of the city resonate
with different states of mind, passions and desires. Interestingly, the
Situationists thought that this attitude to space could only be
sustained for a day or two without risking mental collapse; they also
thought it could only be applied to the city. Rebecca Solnit's
*Wanderlust: a History of Walking* (2000), suggests they were wrong on
the second count. While Deleuze and Guattari's caution against
[[deterritorialization]] (a
term with obvious if unacknowledged debts to Situationism) too far and
too fast in *Mille Plateaux* (1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus*
(1987), would seem to confirm that they were right on the first count.
