[[differend]] 

(différend)

 A
wrong or injustice that arises because the
[[discourse]] in which the
wrong might be expressed does not exist. To put it another way, it is a
wrong or injustice that arises because the prevailing or
[[hegemony]] discourse
actively precludes the possibility of this wrong being expressed. To put
it still another way, it is a wrong or injustice which cannot be proved
to have been a wrong or injustice because the means of doing so has
(also) been denied the victim. [[Lyotard, Jean-François]], who coined this
term in his book *Le Différend* (1983), translated as *The Differend:
Phrases in Dispute* (1988), took as his key exhibit Holocaust denier
Robert Faurisson, whose position is that the only person who can
legitimately testify to the existence of gas chambers is somebody who
actually died in one. One might also point to the situation of the
detainees at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay who as suspects or persons of
interest in the so-called 'War on Terror' are denied the right to a
trial on the grounds that they are neither enemy combatants (which would
be covered by the Geneva convention) nor on US soil (which would place
them under jurisdiction of the US judiciary). The language, the
opportunity, and the means to articulate any wrong that may have
befallen them is also denied them. *See also* [bare
