[[dialectical criticism]]
[[Jameson, Fredric]]'s term
for his approach to literary and cultural analysis. The essential tenets
of the approach---he insists that it is not a method as such, which
would imply a 'one size fits all' attitude which Jameson rejects---were
worked out in detail in *Marxism and Form* (1971) and then further
elaborated in *The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially
Symbolic Act* (1981). As in [[Marx, Karl]]'s conception of the
[[dialectic]], Jameson
insists that dialectical criticism must strive for the scandal of the
unexpected revelation that comes from the demonstration that the
[[Other]] is not as different
from the same as we initially thought. Dialectical criticism should
proceed from the abstract to the concrete, from the imperfectly
understood to the concretely understood, where that would mean
comprehending the true historical nature of existence. In this regard,
dialectical criticism can also be compared to [[Brecht, Bertolt]]'s notion of the
[[estrangement-effect]],
which was doubtless an inspiration in any case. Ultimately, dialectical
criticism should strive to reveal obscure effects of [[class struggle]] in any given text
by reconstructing the historical conditions---particularly the
[[glocalization]]
conditions---that yielded it. Jameson's life-work can be seen as an
astonishingly long and diverse series of demonstrations of both the
versatility and utility of this approach. *See also*
