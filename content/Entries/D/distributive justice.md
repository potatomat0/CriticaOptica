[[distributive justice]]
Socially just allocation of goods and resources. Research in this field
tries to determine what would be a 'fair' way of distributing limited
resources. For instance, it is manifestly unfair that rich countries
like the US use vastly more of the earth's resources than very poor
countries like Guatemala, but it would be equally unfair to scale back
the US's allocation in line with Guatemala's usage since this would
result in a cataclysmic drop in standard of living. Given these uneven
conditions, what is the best path forward so that a socially just
allocation of resources can be achieved? This is the central question
asked by distributive justice. *See also*
