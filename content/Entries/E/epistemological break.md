[[epistemological break]]

 The
moment of rupture separating science from its non-scientific past. After
the rupture the non-scientific past comes to be seen as so much
superstition. In this way, the history of science is understood not so
much a process of discovery as the overcoming of the obstacles to
thought posed by knowledge itself. It thus entails not simply the
addition of new knowledge, but the reorganization of the very
possibility of knowledge. It changes the conditions of what is and can
be known. The concept was conceived by [[Bachelard, Gaston]] and further
developed by [[Canguilhem, Georges]], but it is
perhaps the work of [[Foucault, Michel]] which has done
the most to demonstrate the importance of this concept by taking it
outside of the strictly scientific domain Bachelard and Canguilhem
remained in. Foucault described epistemological breaks not only in the
history of medicine, but also in the history of prisons, sexuality, and
psychiatry.
