[[epistemology]]

 The study or
inquiry into the origin, possibility, and constitution of knowledge. Its
central questions are: what does it mean to know something and by what
means are we able to have knowledge? In asking these questions it also
brings into play issues to do with doubt, scepticism, and truth, because
implicit in the question of what it means to know something is the issue
of whether one's knowledge can ever be complete.
[[epochÄ“]] In Classical Greek
philosophy it refers to the suspension of judgement or scepticism so
that an argument may be heard in full before a decision concerning its
merit is taken. German
[[phenomenology]] [[Husserl, Edmund]] uses this term
(although it is usually rendered in English as 'bracketing') to describe
a methodological procedure of setting aside one's personal knowledge
about the world so as to see more clearly its conceptual core. The aim
is to achieve a pure perception of phenomena, cleansed of
presuppositions and prejudices.
