[[essentialism]]

 A mode of
philosophy which determines
[[ontology]], that is, the
nature of being, by distinguishing between two types of properties a
particular thing may have: those which are essential to it, and those
which are merely accidental. The former are sometimes referred to as
[[essence]]. In contemporary
critical theory the most common form of this way of thinking is to be
found in gender studies, where sexual difference is held by certain
thinkers to be an essential difference between men and women and by
extension a common cause for action (in both a positive and negative
sense---[[sexism]] is the
bias of one [[gender]]
against another, while
[[feminism]] is similarly an
action of one gender against another). The work of [[Butler, Judith]], however,
challenges the essentialist position by offering a conception of gender
that focuses more on the 'accidents' of
[[performativity]].
Similarly, [[Haraway, Donna]]
challenges the essentialist view of gender by challenging the underlying
assumption that it is possible to distinguish between male and female in
an absolute sense to begin with. *See also* [strategic
