[[Eagleton, Terry]]
 (1943--)


Marxist cultural critic. The son of a working-class family of Irish
descent, Eagleton was born in Salford in the north-west of England. He
was educated at De La Salle College and Cambridge University, where he
came under the influence of [[Williams, Raymond]]. He is best known
for his witty, combative and indeed sniping reviewing style. His
*Literary Theory: An Introduction* (1983) introduced an entire
generation of Anglophone literature students to theory. He achieved
proper notoriety when the Prince of Wales decried him to a group of
Oxford students as 'that dreadful Terry Eagleton'.
When Eagleton gained admission to Trinity College, Cambridge to read
English in 1961, it coincided with the high point of the influence of
the doyen of [[Practical Criticism]], [[James, C. L. R.]], and though he
would later write scathingly of both, practical criticism's combative
tone and its emphasis on close reading left its mark. However, the
greater personal and intellectual influences were the Dominican
theologians Laurence Bright and Herbert McCabe and cultural critic
Raymond Williams, whom he encountered at Jesus College, where he moved
to undertake his postgraduate research. Eagleton's PhD, written under
the direction of Williams, examined the work of the minor Victorian poet
and writer Edward Carpenter.
In his student years, Eagleton was heavily involved with the Catholic
Left. He was one of the founding editors of *Slant*, a radical Catholic
journal which sought to challenge the structures of the Catholic Church
in the wake of Vatican II and bring a distinctly Christian perspective
to debates central to the concerns of the New Left. He also wrote two
book-length treatments of this subject in this period, *The New Left
Church* (1967) and *The Body as Language* (1970). Through his
publications in *Slant* as well as in *New Blackfriars* (the Catholic
theological journal), Eagleton sought to demonstrate common ground
between Christian thought and socialism and between religion and
politics more generally. Christ, he proposed, offered a way out of the
existential angst caused by the alienating forces of modern life.
Eagleton left Cambridge in 1969 to take up a position at Oxford, where
he remained for three decades. He then moved to Manchester University
which caused a scandal by imposing mandatory retirement on him when he
reached 65. The publication in 1976 of *Criticism and Ideology* brought
international attention to Eagleton, and established him as one of
Britain's leading Marxist critics. This was followed in quick succession
by *Marxism and Literary Criticism* (1976), a study of [[Benjamin, Walter]] and an
introductory textbook on literary theory. He also wrote regularly for
*New Left Review*. During this period, Eagleton's work was distinguished
by two main preoccupations: Irish literature and history and
postmodernism. Equally outspoken about both, in *Heathcliff and the
Great Hunger* (1995) he showed himself to be one of the staunchest
champions of Irish literature and in *The Illusions of Postmodernism*
(1996) one of the sternest critics of postmodernism.
Since leaving Oxford Eagleton has also settled accounts with theory in
*After Theory* (2001) and made a pronounced turn toward spiritual
matters, going so far as to write a book entitled *The Meaning of Life*
(2007). But he hasn't deserted politics altogether. In 2002 he published
perhaps his most controversial book of all, *Holy Terror*, which in the
aftermath of 9/11 infuriated right-wing critics by (bravely, it has to
be said) highlighting the connection between terrorism and state terror.
He made international news in 2006 when the Australian Archbishop was
accused of plagiarizing his review of Richard Dawkins's polemical book
*The God Delusion* (2006). Showing that advancing age has not dulled his
spirit or wit, Eagleton caused a highly public stir in 2007 by deriding
Kingsley Amis and Martin Amis for their conservatism.
