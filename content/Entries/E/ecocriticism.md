[[ecocriticism]]

 The first
person to use the term appears to have been William Rueckert in 1978,
whose purpose in doing so was to suggest that ecological terms and
concepts can usefully be applied to the study of literature. This,
however, is not the dominant meaning of the term. It tends to be
interpreted more loosely as a general term for the study of the
relationship between literature and the natural environment. Although a
number of critics have considered the importance of the environment in
literature (e.g. Leo Marx and [[Williams, Raymond]]), it was not
until the late 1980s and early 1990s that it became a recognizable
sub-branch of literary and cultural studies. One explanation for this
may be that it was not until then that the environment itself became of
broad and perhaps even urgent concern for many people. Ecocriticism
defines itself as a practice of reading literature from an earth-centred
(rather than human-centred) perspective. There is also an activist
dimension to ecocriticism: at least part of the reason ecocritics want
to discuss the centrality of nature in literature is to raise awareness
more generally about the need for concern and indeed action with regard
to the environment. Unsurprisingly, many ecocritics are also active in
the environmental justice movement, whose concern is the uneven and
generally inequitable distribution of the burden of environmental
degradation (e.g. poorer countries tend to be more polluted than richer
countries). *See also* [ecological
