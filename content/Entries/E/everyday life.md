[[everyday life]]

 A highly
contested term invented for the purpose of registering the effects on
individuals of social and cultural change on both a micro and macro
scale. Its importance can readily be seen in discussions of the impact
of new technology. For example, when email was introduced it transformed
(almost overnight) the way business is conducted and had a similarly
significant flow-on effect on social life as well. It outmoded the
letter and substantially changed the way we think about the telephone.
In other words it changed the way life is conducted at its most mundane
and basic level. This is what the concept of everyday life tries to
capture: life as a set of routines,
[[practices]], ways of
living, thinking, and doing things. Its purpose can be summarized by the
paradox that it aims to see what is extraordinary about the ordinary.
One has only to think of life before (or without) email to get a sense
of the insightfulness of this paradox.
The everyday has been the subject of critical attention for nearly a
century and has drawn the attention of some of the most famous thinkers
of our time. None more famous than [[Freud, Sigmund]], whose concept of
the [[unconscious]] is
attributable to his interest in at least one aspect of the everyday. In
*Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens* (1901), translated as *The Psychopathology of Everyday Life* (1914), Freud set out to theorize what
today are known as 'Freudian slips', namely the accidental (and
sometimes obscene) confusion of words and ideas that frequently occur in
the course of conversation. Freud hypothesized that these slips indicate
that beneath our conscious activity in the unconscious there is an
active set of processes which occasionally make themselves known to the
conscious. He thus identified a fruitful tension between the conscious
and the unconscious, the thought and the unthought, the intended and
unintended, which continues to structure thinking about the everyday in
all its guises. The everyday is simultaneously that which we attend to
and that which we ignore or overlook.
The French philosopher [[Lefebvre, Henri]] is undoubtedly
the one who has done the most to bring the concept of the everyday to
the attention of critical theory and it was precisely this tension
between noticing the everyday and failing to see it that interested him.
He wrote several books on this theme, the best known being the trilogy
*Critique de la vie quotidienne* (1947--81), translated as *Critique of
Everyday Life* (1991--2005). Lefebvre was particularly attentive to the
transformations to daily life wrought by the introduction of new
commodities (his one-time research assistant [[Baudrillard, Jean]] even more so),
which he saw in terms of a colonization of the unconscious. But it was
the vivid moments of disgust, shock, pleasure, and delight that
interrupt the monotony of the quotidian that fascinated him most because
he saw in them a kind of immanent critique of the everyday and the
fleeting promise of a different life. He was in this regard very much a
[[utopia]] thinker and his
privileging of creativity as a force of social change in its own right
exerts a strong influence on [[Cultural Studies]] still.
This is in small measure because of [[Certeau, Michel de]]'s manifesto,
*L'Invention du quotidien 1. arts de faire* (1980), translated as *The Practice of Everyday Life* (1984), which treats creativity as the one
unquenchable form of
[[resistance]] the weak use
against the powerful. But in contrast to Lefebvre, Certeau is more
interested in the evanescent than the material. His key exhibit is the
practice known in French as 'la perruque' (loosely translated as
'wigging it'), whereby workers conduct personal business on their
employer's time---probably the most common form of this today is the
time people devote to Facebook while they are at work. For Certeau, the
everyday is that which escapes any and all attempts to either control it
or document it. As such, it doesn't even leave a trace and Certeau is
scathing of attempts by sociologists to quantify it statistically or
otherwise. Inspiring though this work has been from the point of view of
trying to think about the possibility of resistance, it is also
self-defeating inasmuch as its research object is by its own definition
impossible to grasp.
Between these two poles of interest in and indifference to the material,
defined by Lefebvre and Certeau, there are a number of important authors
whose work has touched on the question of the everyday. Most
prominently, these include, [[Blanchot, Maurice]] for whom the
everyday is the ineffable; [[Braudel, Fernand]] whose exhaustive
trilogy *The Structures of Everyday Life* (1975--9) plumbs the depths of
the everyday in all its minutiae going back to the Middle Ages; [[Goffman, Erving]], for whom the
everyday is a performance; [[Vaneigem, Raoul]], the Belgian
[[Situationism]], and Agnes
Heller, for whom (following
[[Lukács, György]]) the everyday is
the site of possible redemptive politics. To this list must be added the
name [[Barthes, Roland]],
whose great
[[Other]]-inspired
*Mythologies* (1957), translated as *Mythologies* (1972) continues to
set the standard for perceiving the extraordinary in the ordinary.
