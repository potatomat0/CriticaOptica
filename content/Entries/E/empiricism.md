[[empiricism]]

 A mode of
philosophical reasoning which holds that the only reliable source of
knowledge is experience (i.e. that which can be observed). It denies
that there is any knowledge outside of the realm of the observable. The
main empiricist philosophers are: David Hume, John Locke, and John
Stuart Mill. It therefore rejects concepts like [[Kant, Immanuel]]'s notion of the
categories, which cannot be sensed directly, but whose existence must be
inferred (we cannot observe the universe in its entirety, but its
existence may be inferred). Kant's entire philosophical career was
directed against the empiricist philosophy and towards building an
alternative, which he termed critical philosophy (the philosophical
basis of [[critical theory]]). In the wake of
Kant, philosophy has split into two: continental and empiricist. The
former, which is Kantian or critical in outlook, is so named by the
latter because it is primarily European in origin, whereas empiricism is
almost exclusively British and North American (also known as [[analytic philosophy]]).
