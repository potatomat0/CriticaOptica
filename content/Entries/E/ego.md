[[ego]] 

(*Ich*)

A central
concept in [[psychoanalysis]]
which is present in [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s earliest writings,
but gains in prominence with the elaboration of the second
[[topography]] in 1920. The
ego is that part of the psychical apparatus which acts as an agent of
the self. However, it is only one part of the psychical apparatus and
cannot be fully understood in isolation from the other components,
namely the [[id]] and the
[[superego]]. It is the
product of a gradual process of differentiation in early childhood
between the internal impulses of
[[desire]] rising up from the
id and the equally powerful pressures of external reality (whose avatar
is the superego). In contrast, [[Lacan, Jacques]] treats the ego as a
kind of mirage, an illusory product of what he calls the
[[mirror stage]] phase. The ego is
organized, whereas the id is not; it is a focal point for ideas, and
more importantly for
[[cathexis]]. It is the ego
which calibrates [[pleasure]]
and decides what is and what is not pleasurable. Freud described the ego
as being like a rider sitting on a horse, the horse being the id; like a
rider, the ego draws on the energy of the forces it sits astride (namely
the [[instinct]]), but it
must also take care to defend itself against those very same forces,
which have the power to unseat it. Symptoms like
[[anxiety]] and
[[hysteria]] are the ego's
pathological response to the pressures of the id.
