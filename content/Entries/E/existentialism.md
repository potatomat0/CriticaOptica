[[existentialism]]

 A mode of
philosophy which emerged in the latter part of the nineteenth century
and came into prominence in the middle part of the twentieth century. It
foregrounds the perplexing condition of the modern
[[subject]] who, in the
absence of God, is forced to contend with the meaninglessness of life.
This does not necessarily mean that existentialism is a secular
philosophy, though largely speaking it is, because the absence of God
can be understood to mean that humans have forsaken God or that God has
forsaken humans (i.e. God still exists: He just does not involve Himself
in human affairs). Both of the so-called 'fathers' of existentialism,
Søren Kierkegaard and [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]], start from this
position and argue for a
[[metaphysics]] of truth and
freedom in
response---[[authenticity]]
thus replaces piety as the new condition for the righteous to aspire to.
Instead of being true to God, one must rather be true to oneself, but
this is difficult for two reasons: first, there is the apparent logical
impossibility of the self knowing the self; second, there is the problem
of knowing how one should act. In the early twentieth century,
[[phenomenology]] confronted
the question of how the subject makes sense of their world, and although
it did not concern itself overly much with the metaphysical question of
how one should act, it had a significant influence on existentialism all
the same because of its account of
[[apperception]] (derived
from [[actant]]), which solves
the first problem. The second problem, namely the question of how one
should act preoccupied existentialism's most important theorist
[[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] and
answering it effectively became his life's work. Sartre popularized the
term existentialism (which he borrowed from Gabriel Marcel, who first
used it in the mid-1920s), in his short book *L'existentialisme est un
humanisme* (1946), translated as *Existentialism and Humanism* (1948),
which summarized and simplified his previous book, *L'Être et le néant*
(1943), translated as *Being and Nothingness* (1958), which is for many
the definitive work on the subject. Sartre's novels, particularly *La Nausée* (1938), translated as *Nausea* (1959), are also taken to be
important contributions to existentialism because they dramatize the
situation of the subject confronted by the brute fact of existence. The
label existentialism has also been applied to the work of both [[Heidegger, Martin]] and [[Jaspers, Karl]], though neither of
them accepted the term themselves.
