[[ethology]]

 A branch of
zoology concerned with the scientific analysis of animal behaviour.
Principally it wants to know why animals do what they do and what
evolutionary advantage they derive from it. Its perspective is
biological rather than psychological and it tends to look across a range
of species, rather than at single animals. Its object of study is what
is usually referred to as instinct, behavioural triggers 'hard-wired'
into the brain determining in a fixed way how an animal will respond to
a specific stimulus. For example, experiments show that nesting graylag
geese will roll any egg-like object (such as a golf ball) towards their
nest if they see it and will continue the rolling action even if you
remove the egg. Another well-known example is the notion of 'pecking
order', which ethologists observed in chickens. Ethology is also
interested in the way animals learn, from each other and their
environment, and develop new types of response to stimulus. Ethology was
established as a discipline by the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen in
collaboration with Austrian biologist Konrad Lorenz in the 1960s.
Together with Karl von Frisch they were awarded the Nobel Prize in
physiology in 1973. In the 1970s, through publications such as Robert
Ardrey's *The Social Contract* (1970) and E. O. Wilson's *Sociobiology*
(1975), there was an attempt to use ethology to account for human
behaviour. French critical theorists [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]] also use the
notion of ethology in *Milles Plateaux* (1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987), which they connect to the work of the Dutch
philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Analytical psychologist [[Jung, Carl]]'s theory of the
[[archetype]] has been
compared to ethology inasmuch as it also seeks to describe a system of
innate patterning of behaviour.
