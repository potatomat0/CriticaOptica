[[ego-ideal]] 

(*Ichideal*)

The ideal form of 'I' the
[[ego]]
[[poetics]] after it has
overcome the [[narcissism]]
of childhood (or what
[[Freud, Anna]] calls the [[ideal ego]]). In his early work,
Freud makes little distinction between the ego-ideal and the
[[superego]], but he
gradually distinguishes it as that in the psychical apparatus which
makes human collectivity possible. As he explains in his 1921 book on
group psychology, in his view large groups are formed out of a
collective fascination for powerful leaders: in submitting to their
will, the subject effectively substitutes their ideal-ego for his or her
own. The leader becomes the image of the ego the subject wishes he or
she actually had.
