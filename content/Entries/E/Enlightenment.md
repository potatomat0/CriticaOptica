[[Enlightenment]]
**(*Aufklärung*)** A broad intellectual movement in Europe characterized
by a foregrounding of the power of reason and a setting aside of
superstition. There is no consensus as to when exactly the Enlightenment
began, but it is not generally thought to have started much before the
publication in 1637 of René Descartes's *Discours de la méthode pour
bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la vérité dans les sciences*
(Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of
Seeking Truth in the Sciences), in which the famous slogan celebrating
the centrality of reason '*Je pense, donc je suis*' (I think, therefore
I am) appears. Other highpoints include: The Encylopédistes, the group
of authors led by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert who wrote
the massive *Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des
arts et des métiers* (Encyclopedia, or a systematic dictionary of the
sciences, arts, and crafts), between 1751 and 1772, with the express
purpose of changing the way people think by foregrounding scientifically
acquired knowledge and banishing superstition; the Scottish
Enlightenment, contemporaneous with the Encylopédistes, whose leading
figures were David Hume, Adam Smith, and Robert Burns; in the US the
group of statesmen who wrote the bill of rights were also considered
part of the Enlightenment movement. In [[critical theory]], however,
Enlightenment is usually dated by the publication in 1784 of [[Kant, Immanuel]]'s essay 'Beantwortung
der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?' (Answering the Question: What is
Enlightenment?), which famously defines Enlightenment as the coming to
an end of humanity's period of intellectual immaturity. *See also*
