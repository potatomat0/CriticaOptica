[[ecofeminism]]

 A philosophical
and political position which posits that there is a connection between
the social mentality underpinning the domination of women in patriarchal
society and the domination and degradation of nature by industrial
capitalism. The term was coined by French feminist and science fiction
writer, Françoise d'Eubonne in *Le Féminisme ou la mort* (1974)
(Feminism or Death), a work that envisioned a future in which feminist
attitudes prevailed, thus saving the planet from its seemingly
inexorable course towards eco-death. Ecofeminism challenges the meaning
of 'productivity', arguing that industrial, value-adding productivity is
very far from the only form of productivity there is and that the
hegemonic form is environmentally unsustainable. There is no single form
of ecofeminism, but all forms have at their core the belief that
addressing the causes of the imbalance of power between the sexes is
essential to averting environmental disaster, that in other words it is
only by changing deep-seated social and cultural attitudes that
effective steps to save the planet can be made. Disagreement between the
various branches of ecofeminism tends to hinge on whether the connection
between women and nature is a source of power or oppression. A
substantial body of work has developed under this rubric in most of the
major languages.

[[École Freudienne de Paris]]
**(Freudian School of Paris)** Founded by [[Lacan, Jacques]] in 1964 after he was
expelled from the International Psychoanalytical Association, to train
analysts to practise as psychoanalysts. The founding members of the
School included [[Certeau, Michel de]], [[Castoriadis, Cornelius]], [[Guattari, Félix]], and [[Irigaray, Luce]]. At the
invitation of [[Althusser, Louis]], the school was
based at École Normale Supérieure. Its membership fluctuated between 150
and 600 according to the changes in political tides. Lacan dissolved the
School abruptly in January 1980.
