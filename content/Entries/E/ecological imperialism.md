[[ecological imperialism]]

 A
theory conceived by Alfred Crosby (1931--2018) in his 1986 book
*Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900--1900*,
which proposes that colonization was not only a form of cultural and
political tyranny, it was also a form of environmental terrorism.
Indeed, Crosby went so far as to argue that the ecological dimension was
in fact primary. His reason for suggesting this was the evident fact
that wherever colonists settled they brought with them diseases that
devastated the local populations (of both people and plants and animals)
as well as invasive pests and weeds that encroached on the existing
flora and fauna, and eventually starved them out of existence.
European-style agricultural practice utilized in dry regions like
Australia and South Africa has had a catastrophic environmental impact.
Crosby's work sparked an enhanced interest in the role and significance
of the environment in understanding colonial history in [[Postcolonial Studies]].
[[écriture féminine]]
**(feminine writing)** [[Cixous, Hélène]] coined this term in
the widely read essay 'Le Rire de la Méduse' (The Laugh of Medusa) to
describe a kind of writing that is outside of the masculine economy of
patriarchal discourse. Cixous envisages *écriture féminine* as a form of
writing that would, in psychoanalyst [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s terms, reside or
take place in the realm of the
[[real]], rather than the
[[symbolic]]. In
[[psychoanalysis]] terms it
therefore takes the form of the expression of the inexpressible and can
only be arrived at via experimentation and play. Interestingly, Cixous's
canonical examples of writers capable of attaining this effect are
Shakespeare, Kleist, and Genet.
