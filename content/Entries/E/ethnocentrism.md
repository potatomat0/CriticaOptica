[[ethnocentrism]]

 The tendency
to or practice of interpreting, evaluating, and judging ethnic groups
perceived as [[theory]] by the
standards of one's own ethnic group. Moreover, it implies that the group
performing the judging of the other regard their own standards to be at
once 'higher' than the other's and, more importantly, defining the norm.
The description of Indigenous Peoples as 'savages' and 'barbarians' by
European explorers and colonizers is a clear example of this bias
because there is no recognition whatsoever of the validity of the
other's perspective.
