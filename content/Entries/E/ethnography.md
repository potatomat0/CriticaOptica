[[ethnography]]

 Anthropological
research based on direct or participant observation of a select group of
people's way of life. Traditionally the observed group would be outside
of the observer's own ethnic group and more often than not of a
'primitive' or 'indigenous' origin. The aim of the research would be to
discover the ways in which its behaviours, habits, and
[[practices]] differed from
that of the observer's. The basic premise of the research was that the
'primitive' others were on a historical trajectory that in time would
see them 'advance' to the same degree of 'civilization' as that of the
western observer, therefore their society could be treated as
'pre-historical', as that which came before civilization as it is known
in the West. This view of the other has since been overturned by
[[Postcolonial Studies]],
which has shown that ethnography of this older unreconstructed variety
never really engaged with the actual other because its own prejudices
and preconceptions got in the way. Unable to overcome its seemingly
inherent [[ethnocentrism]],
all it saw was a phantasm of its own creation. This critique has created
significant problems for ethnographers operating today and it has forced
them to engage in interesting and creative ways with critical theory
(particularly the concept of
[[alterity]]) to address
these problems. This has resulted in some fascinating work by people
like [[Geertz, Clifford]],
James Clifford, George Marcus, and [[Taussig, Michael]]. More recently,
and perhaps in part because of the epistemological difficulties created
by the critique of traditional ethnography, ethnographers have turned
their attention towards their own culture, which they then (somewhat
paradoxically) proceed to treat as strange as though it were not really
their culture at all (see, for example, the work of French
anthropologist [[Aug√©, Marc]],
who started his career working in Africa, but later focused his research
on Paris). Along these lines, there has been fascinating work done on
how office bureaucracies and scientific laboratories function---see
respectively Tess Lea *Bureaucrats and Bleeding Hearts* (2008) and Bruno
Latour *Science in Action* (1987).
