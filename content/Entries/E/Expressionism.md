[[Expressionism]]

 A
pan-European movement in the arts---especially painting---that developed
in the first third of the twentieth century. Rejecting impressionism and
naturalism, expressionism is anti-realist in both approach and subject
matter. It aims to 'render visible' (to use one of its leading artists
Paul Klee's famous phrase) that which escapes representational painting,
such as the raw effects of emotion, sexuality and spirituality. Inspired
by the writings of the founder of
[[psychoanalysis]], [[Freud, Sigmund]], which explore the
hidden world of the
[[unconscious]],
expressionism wants to shed light on the complex impulses underpinning
daily life. The leading figures of this movement were the Viennese
painters Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele and the Norwegian Edvard Munch
whose 'Scream' paintings are perhaps the sine qua non of the
Expressionist style. *See also* [German
