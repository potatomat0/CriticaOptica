[[Eisenstein, Sergei]]
(1898--1948) Russian pioneer film-maker and film-theorist. He was born
in Riga (then part of Imperial Russia, but now the capital of Latvia) to
a middle-class family. His parents separated in 1905 and he moved with
his mother to St Petersburg. He studied architecture and engineering at
the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering. He participated in the
1917 revolutions and in 1918 he joined the Red Army. He was stationed in
Minsk for three years, which brought him into contact with Japanese
culture (Kabuki theatre, with its aesthetic of the unexpected, in
particular, impressed him). In 1920 he moved to Moscow and joined the
artistic fray there between
[[realism]] and
[[constructivism]], siding
with the latter. He worked initially in the theatre as a designer and
progressed from there to film, which is where he made his mark, creating
several enduring masterpieces such as *Battleship Potemkin* (1925),
*October* (1927), and *Ivan the Terrible* (1944). As both film-maker and
film-theorist, Eisenstein took a
[[dialectic]] view of
cinema: it was, for him, at once a powerful rhetorical device and a
higher means of knowing the universe. This is the principle behind the
concept for which Eisenstein is best known, namely montage. Inspired by
Japanese haiku poetry, but clearly owing a debt to both
[[genre]] and
[[Marxism]], montage achieves
its effect through the collision of different kinds of
[[sign]] forcing the mind to
reach for a higher unified meaning. Montage works in two directions at
once: by pushing the audience towards a synthesis of meaning not present
in the film itself, it also compels the audience to pay more attention
to what is before them. In contrast to his Hollywood contemporaries,
Eisenstein was not interested in obtaining a completely realistic look
in his films; in his view, reality did not speak for itself.
Eisenstein's *Film Form* (1949) and *Film Sense* (1942) are standard
starting points for virtually any study of the history of film.
