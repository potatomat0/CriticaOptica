[[Empire]]

 A prophetic and
utopian concept which attempts to theorize in philosophical terms the
nature of the new paradigm of power and right that emerged alongside
[[globalization]] in the
latter half of the twentieth century. Conceived by Italian Marxist
[[Negri, Antonio]] and
American Marxist [[Hardt, Michael]] in their bestselling
book *Empire* (2000), Empire is in effect a new form of
[[sovereignty]], which is at
once a brutal new power-regime bathed in blood and a new set of
possibilities for liberation. Hardt and Negri claim that the sovereign
authority of nation-states has declined absolutely in the post-World War
II era. Taking its place is a new logic of rule or
[[governmentality]], Empire,
which yokes together multinational corporations and supranational
organizations (e.g. the International Monetary Fund) to produce not only
a new form of subjectivity, but also a new form of value as well. Proof
of its existence, they say, is to be found in the fact that no nation,
not even the USA, is capable by itself of controlling the whole world in
all its facets. Similarly, the fact that all nations are at the mercy of
global trends in finance capital (as the sub-prime loan meltdown in 2007
made apparent) is symptomatic of their relative lack of
[[authority]] in the
postmodern world. In contrast to the nation-state model of sovereignty,
Empire is a decentred and
[[deterritorialization]]
apparatus of rule, which has no history, no fixed centre and no boundary
lines demarcating its territory. Contra
[[fort/da]], it endlessly
espouses a master narrative in which it presents itself as universal and
all-inclusive, as having always been there and encompassing the entire
world right down to its ganglia. The acknowledged inspirations for the
concept of Empire are Foucault's notion of
[[biopower]] and
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[authority]]'s concept of
desiring-production, but Hardt and Negri tax Foucault with failing to
grasp biopower's true dynamism and Deleuze and Guattari with spoiling
their concept by rendering power too chaotic. Although it appears bleak
in that it is a form of power that, as Foucault argued with respect to
biopower, is interested in populations rather than people, Empire has
its affirmative dimensions too. Its modification of sovereignty has
created a new political constituency, which Hardt and Negri refer to as
the [[multitude]], which in
their view is destined to invent new forms of democracy that will take
us beyond Empire's uninviting landscape toward a more hopeful and
egalitarian space. Empire has provoked fierce debate. The Right dismiss
it out of hand as fanciful, while the Left demand more rigour in its
empirical analyses.
