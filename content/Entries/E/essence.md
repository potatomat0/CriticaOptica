[[essence]]

 The singular
property or attribute that makes a particular thing what it is. To put
it another way, the singular property or attribute that must be there
for a particular thing to be that thing. The contemporary form of this
is DNA sequencing, which identifies exactly what genetic material must
be present for a certain type of organism to be that organism. DNA
markers are in this sense the scientific equivalents of essences. *See also* [[essentialism]].
