[[epic]]

 A long, narrative poem
praising the deeds and person of a hero, often for their efforts in
either founding or saving a particular community. The epic is an
extremely old form in literature. Indeed, the oldest known written text
is *The Epic of Gilgamesh*, whose origin is put at more than 3000 years
bc. Other well-known epics include: Homer's Trojan War poems, *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*, thought to date from around 800 bc, the
slightly later Indian work, *Mahābhārata*, and the Anglo-Saxon *Beowulf*
from ad 800. The principal defining feature of the epic is the grandness
of scale and the sense that the destiny of the individual is the destiny
of the whole world. In contemporary literature it is primarily the
fantasy genre, typified by J. R. R. Tolkien's work, which adheres to the
epic form, in prose, though, rather than verse.
