[[ethnomethodology]]

 A form of
[[ethnography]] interested in
discovering the rules governing social
[[practices]], devised by
American sociologist Harold Garfinkel. Ultimately, though, what he
discovered, contra his teacher Talcott Parson's thesis, is that social
practices are not strictly speaking rule-governed, if by that one means
for every type of social practice there exists a specific set of rules
(written or unwritten) that one can refer to in order to clarify how one
should proceed. In his landmark text *Studies in Ethnomethodology*
(1967), Garfinkel describes investigations into how juries operate, and
what transvestites have to know in order to 'pass', and shows that,
while jurors and transvestites can give idealized accounts of what they
think they need to do in order to accomplish their tasks, the reality is
that generally speaking they do not know why they do what they do. For
Garfinkel this is the problem with any form of ethnography or social
science that relies on interviewing subjects in order to gain knowledge
about them: if the subjects themselves don't know why they do what they
do, then their answers to surveys and so on cannot be relied upon as
explanations of cultural practices. Garfinkel's way of getting round
this was to conduct what he referred to as 'breach experiments'. He
would ask his students to do things like take a watermelon to the
drycleaners and record the drycleaner's response, so as to bring to the
fore the unspoken rules relied on in social engagements.
