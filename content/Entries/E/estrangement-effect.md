[[estrangement-effect]]
**(*Verfremdungseffekt*)** [[Brecht, Bertolt]]'s term
(alsosometimes translated as alienation-effect) for the moment in a work
of art when thatwhich used to appear natural suddenly appears
historical, when that which wasthought of as timeless and eternal is
seen as deliberately caused and altered acrosstime. Its purpose is
political because it aims to overturn the paralysing sense thatthings
have always been 'this way' and therefore that there is nothingthat can
be done to change them. Brecht's principal means of doing this was to
stagetheatre in such a way that the viewer is denied the habitual
comfort of forgettingthat they are watching a play and becoming (what
[[psychoanalysis]]
filmcritics call) [[suture]]
into the events on stage. Thus he would discourageactors from 'becoming'
their characters and using that to elicit theempathy of the audience,
preferring that they create a sense of'distance' between themselves and
their character that would put theaudience in two minds about what they
were watching (Brecht's ideal manner ofviewing, he famously said, was
that of the sports fan evaluating a boxing match).French cultural critic
[[Barthes, Roland]] deployed
this principal in *Mythologies* (1957), translated as *Mythologies*
(1972), which is aspirited attack on everything that appears 'natural'
in modern life inthe era of [[late capitalism]]. *See also*
[[cognitive estrangement]];
[[ostranenie]].
