[[episteme]]

 French historian
[[Foucault, Michel]] uses this
term, which literally means knowledge in Greek, to name the set of
conditions which enable something to be known. The episteme, for
Foucault, is the condition of possibility of knowledge, and in his view
there can only ever be one episteme at any one moment in history. It is
not, however, the body of knowledge itself. In this regard, it is
similar in many respects to [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]]'s later concept
of the [[rhizome]] inasmuch
as what it actually names is the dispersed and discontinuous *relations*
between the multitude of elements that combine to produce so-called
knowledge.
