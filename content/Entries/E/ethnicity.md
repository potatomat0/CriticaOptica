[[ethnicity]]

 Derived from the
Greek 'ethnos', which is usually rendered as 'nation', it designates
shared beliefs, values, experiences, loyalties and a subjective sense of
common origin among self-defined groups of people. The term is close in
meaning to [[race]], but is
often used in preference because it lacks the latter's problematic
biological dimension. In contrast to race, which tends to be used to
express hierarchical discrepancies in power, ethnicity is a matter of
self-perception and is generally of an affirmative order. It primarily
refers to cultural distinctiveness. However, in its first usage it was
used to designate heathen 'others', and a trace of this pejorative
origin lingers inasmuch as ethnicity is usually only used in relation to
minority, or other
non-[[hegemony]] groups.
