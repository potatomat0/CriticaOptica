[[Epic Theatre]]

 A highly
politicized,
[[Marxism]]-oriented form of
theatre developed in Germany in the early part of the twentieth century
by Erwin Piscator. It is, however, Piscator's one-time collaborator
[[Brecht, Bertolt]] who is the
better known exponent of Epic Theatre. Indeed Brecht's name is virtually
synonymous with Epic Theatre, despite the fact that it had a number of
other quite prominent adherents including both Mayakovsky and Meyerhold.
Doubtless this is due to Brecht's fame as well as his extensive writings
on the subject. Epic Theatre is typified by its deliberately
anti-realist and anti-naturalist approach. It aims to shatter the
sometimes stupefying 'spell' theatre can cast over its audience by
constantly reminding the audience that what they are seeing is both
artificial and contrived and something that should be evaluated and
judged. Brecht rejected theatre that was spectacular or melodramatic; he
wanted theatre that made people think. For example, actors move in and
out of character and comment on what their character is doing, perhaps
expressing distaste; the dialogue and the narrative play havoc with
continuity and temporality, so characters say things like 'I'm just off
to the thirty years war'; and intertitles, like they use in silent
cinema, are used to create a counterview to what is occurring on stage.
Brecht often said theatre should be like a car crash with the audience
called on to bear witness to what happened and determine for themselves
how the event should be assessed. *See also* [theatre of
