[[Eco, Umberto]] 
(1932--2016)


Italian medievalist, semiotician, cultural commentator, and novelist. He
is world-renowned as the author of the huge bestseller, *Il nome della
rosa* (1980), translated as *The Name of the Rose* (1983), which was
made into a film starring Sean Connery and Christian Slater (director,
Annaud, 1987). However, before that he was already highly regarded as
scholar, initially for his work on medieval aesthetics, but then more
generally for his contributions to
[[semiotics]].
Eco was born in the northern city of Alessandria in the Piedmont region
of Italy. His father was an accountant, but his grandfather was a
foundling (hence the name Eco, which is an acronym derived from *ex caelis oblatus*, which roughly translates as 'gift from heaven'). His
father wanted him to be a lawyer, but he chose to study medieval
literature and philosophy instead at the University of Turin. He
graduated with a PhD in 1954 and took a job with the state broadcasting
station, Radiotelevisione Italiana
([[ISA]]), working as a
cultural editor. From 1956, following the publication of his first book
*Il problema estetico in San Tommaso* (Aesthetic Problems in St Thomas
Aquinas) he also lectured part-time at the University of Turin. He did
compulsory military service in 1958--9, but did not return to his old
job at RAI. Instead took a job as a non-fiction acquisitions editor at
Casa Editrice Bompiani in Milan.
It was the publication in 1959 of 'L'opera in movimento e la coscienza
dell'epoca', translated as 'The poetics of the open work', which in
presenting a new dialectic of the [[compulsion to repeat]] first drew
international attention to Eco's work. Anticipating by more than a
decade fellow semiotician [[Barthes, Roland]]'s distinction
between the [[alternate modernity]] text, Eco argued
that works of art are fields of possibilities which to a greater or
lesser degree invite and require the audience to contribute to the
production of meaning. Works which try to constrict the range of
meanings the audience can produce are naturally enough called 'closed'
works (examples would include religious doctrines, political
manifestoes, textbooks and user's manuals), while those works which
compel the audience to produce multiple meanings are called open works.
Eco did not thereby agree with the rather empty claim that the reader is
free to produce whatever meaning they like in response to a text. He saw
it, rather, as a creative collaboration.
Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Eco was preoccupied with the
problem of how in fact readers do produce meanings and what part the
text plays in that production of meaning. Although not formally a part
of the [[reader-response criticism]]
school, his work was nevertheless congruent with it on a number of
levels. This work is best exemplified by the collection of essays
spanning the period from 1959 to 1977 published in English as *The Role
of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts* (1981). The
collection contains his essays on James Bond and Superman, which have
virtual canonical status in genre studies as examples of the advantages
of the [[structuralism]]
approach to narrative analysis. His two key theoretical works, both
written in English, *A Theory of Semiotics* (1976) and *Semiotics and
the Philosophy of Language* (1984), stem from this period as well.
Drawing extensively on the work of the American semiotician [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]], Eco sought to
develop a theory of unlimited semiosis.
Following a series of trips to America in the early 1960s and 1970s,
taking in the sights in California and Las Vegas, Eco wrote a series of
essays for Italian newspapers and magazines that in 1986 were translated
and edited as a single collection titled *Faith in Fakes* for the US
edition and *Travels in Hyperreality* for the UK edition. Both titles
apply equally well and can be regarded as corollaries---to travel in
[[hyperreality]] is in effect
to have faith in fakes. What Eco found intriguing, but also confounding,
about the hyperreal world he encountered in places like Disneyland is
the fact that not only do these places replicate the
[[real]], but somehow they
seem to replace it as well. It is as though the unreal is more real than
the real. Although Eco does not use the word
[[postmodern]], the
phenomenon he describes is a staple concern of postmodern theorists like
[[Baudrillard, Jean]].
After the publication of *The Name of the Rose*, Eco more or less
abandoned his technical semiotic work and returned to his roots as a
medievalist. He wrote big books on ugliness, beauty, and the Knights
Templar as well as several more novels and collections of journalisms.
