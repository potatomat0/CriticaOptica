[[Empson, William]] 
(1906--84)


British literary critic, often regarded as one of the greatest of his
generation, and poet. A keen and intuitive exponent of 'close reading',
Empson is often associated with [[New Criticism]] and [[Practical Criticism]], but despite
certain family resemblances his work differs from those schools in
important ways. Perhaps most importantly, Empson always emphasized the
importance of both the author's biography and historical context in
understanding literature, two things the New Critics and Practical
Critics assiduously avoided.
He was born in Yorkshire into a family of well-off intellectuals. At the
age of 7 he won a scholarship to Winchester College, where he excelled
in spite of the school's famous emphasis on sports and rugged
discipline. From there he succeeded in obtaining a scholarship to
Magdalene College at Cambridge, where he took a double first in
Mathematics and English, graduating in 1929. His director of studies in
English was [[Richards, Ivor Armstrong]], who recognized
his genius and encouraged him to pursue his studies in that field.
Legend has it that Empson wrote his first book, *Seven Types of
Ambiguity* (1930) as undergraduate essays for Richards. It was an
immediate and substantial success; it not only sold well, it was
received warmly by the leading lights of literary criticism is the UK
and US, T. S. Eliot and John Crowe Ransom respectively, and quickly
became required reading for university students.
In spite of his success, Empson's career faltered at this point. Condoms
were found in his rooms by a servant and worse still so was a young
woman. The University's reaction was swift and harsh. Empson was not
only excluded from the university, but he was forbidden to live in
Cambridge. This prevented him from obtaining either an MA or PhD there.
He moved to London, briefly, making a living with freelance writing and
editing, then took a three-year post teaching English in Tokyo. There he
acquired an interest in Noh theatre, becoming expert enough to write a
book on it, which sadly was lost on his return to London in 1934. He
remained in London for three years, in which time he completed his
second major book, *Some Versions of Pastoral* (1935) as well as a major
collection of poetry.
In 1937 he accepted a job at the National Peking University, but by the
time he arrived in China the Japanese had invaded and there was in fact
no job for him. He remained in China for two years, eking out a living
teaching at various universities in exile there, constantly on the run
from the Japanese forces. Relying on a prodigious memory and precious
few books he was able to continue working, and started on his magnum
opus *The Structure of Complex Words* (1951). He returned to China after
the war, for another brief stint. In the early 1950s he accepted a
Professorship at the University of Sheffield and worked there until his
retirement in 1971.
In his interest in the complexity of language, Empson's work anticipated
key elements of
[[structuralism]],
[[post-structuralism]], and
[[deconstruction]], but he
despised these developments as a profound betrayal of good writing. He
particularly rejected the idea that literary texts should be read in the
absence of any consideration of authorial intention as the adherents of
the [[intentional fallacy]]
insist. He took the view that even if one can only guess at an author's
intentions, that guess should always be made. His reasoning was that
critics must at least attempt to understand the author's feelings if
they are to have any chance of understanding the work.
Empson was a singular writer and though his work is widely admired, it
is difficult to emulate, so it has not given rise to a school or a large
following.
