[[instinct]]

 An inner
compulsion to act 'hard-wired' into the body. According to
[[psychoanalysis]], instincts
have four features: a biological source (opinion varies as to what this
source is, but usually it is assumed to be genetic); a supply of energy
from that source (e.g. the
[[libido]]); a specific aim
which, when achieved, gives rise to satisfaction, or a discharge of
energy (e.g. [[cathexis]]);
and an [[object]], namely the
means of attaining a specific aim.
[[ethology]], which is the
behavioural study of animals, postulates that there are six basic
instincts: sex, fighting, parenting, sleeping, territoriality, and
grooming. The key implication of this is that instincts are thought to
be unstoppable because they originate in a part of the body that is
outside the realm of thought. By the same token, some instincts---like
parenting and grooming---might be learned behaviour and not instinctual
at all; similarly, even the apparently obvious instincts like sex,
necessary to the reproduction of certain species, are anything but
straightforward. For
[[Freud, Anna]], instincts are
something which both the conscious and
[[unconscious]] must come to
terms with. He suggests there are four possibilities: reversal into its
opposite (i.e. an active demand converted into passive acceptance);
turning against the self (i.e. making the self into an object);
[[repression]]; and
[[sublimation]]. Freud always
distinguished between the *Instinkt* and the *Trieb*, but rather
unhelpfully this distinction is obliterated in the English translation
because James Strachey translates both as
[[drive]]. The difference
between the two is, however, crucial, and one could say that [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s career is built on
emphasizing the latter over the former.
