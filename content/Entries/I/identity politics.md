[[identity politics]]

 A form of
politics premised on the idea that all people are different and that
difference not only has to be respected, it also makes it impossible for
one person to completely understand or empathize with another. At this
level, identity politics would just be another word for
[[anomie]], but it is rarely
played out at the level of the individual subject.
[[identity]] in this context
is generally thought of in terms of belonging to collectives determined
by one or more of several basic social categories such as
[[class]],
[[race]],
[[gender]], religion,
ethnicity, and so on. The effect can be paradoxical, as the women's
movement discovered in the 1970s, when lesbians, women of colour, women
from the [[Third World]], and
others, began to argue that gender by itself was not a universal
category capable of uniting all women under one banner. By the same
token, as a politics it is fraught with the difficulty of separating it
from a special interest view of the world which might just as well serve
the interests of merchant bankers as any other minority group. Since the
late 1990s, however, the politics of [[social movement]], which is
issue-driven and inclusive, has largely replaced identity politics. *See also* [strategic
