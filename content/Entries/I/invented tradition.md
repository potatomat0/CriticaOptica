[[invented tradition]]

 A set of
practices, usually of a ritual or symbolic nature, which seek to
inculcate values and norms of behaviour by repetition, e.g., saluting
the flag before class. These practices seek to establish continuity
between an uncertain present and a carefully circumscribed image of the
past. This past is often as much of an invention as the tradition
associated with it. The invented tradition has every appearance of being
an actual tradition, in that it repeats images and symbols drawn from
the past (real or imagined), but is in fact both of a relatively recent
origin and artificially created. British historian [[Hobsbawm, Eric]] identified this
phenomenon in a collection of essays he edited with Terence Ranger, *The Invention of Tradition* (1983). Hobsbawm suggests that invented
traditions serve three purposes: they help to establish social cohesion;
they legitimize institutions and relations of authority; and they
concretize beliefs and value systems. One of the most striking examples
of an invented tradition adduced in this collection is Scottish
tartan---the colourful clan tartans tourists purchase along the Royal
Mile in Edinburgh are in fact an early nineteenth-century invention, not
the ancient tradition they appear to be. Hobsbawm's point, however, is
not to mock such deceptions, but to highlight the
[[glocalization]] importance of
the perception of continuity with the past.
