[[interpellation]]

 The
non-coercive process in which an individual is called upon by a
particular social formation to
[[ecofeminism]] themselves
as a [[subject]] and thereby
forget that they are constituted by society rather than constitutive of
society as they henceforth imagine themselves to be.
[[ideology]] recruits
individuals and transforms them into subjects (which for Althusser
implies they are simultaneously the subjects of society, meaning the
products of society, and subjected to society, meaning subordinate to
society) by persuading them to occupy a subject position it has prepared
for them. The most straightforward example of this process is probably
that of nationality, which government is constantly exhorting its
citizens to adopt as the basis of both individual and collective
identity. But this process should not be thought of as a kind of
becoming; for Althusser, ideology is eternal, so one is always already
interpellated, or, to put it another way, ideology has no outside---one
is always already inside ideology. The pivotal notion of misrecognition
is drawn from French psychoanalyst [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s account of the
[[mirror stage]] in the
developmental psychology of very young children. Althusser hypothesizes
that just as babies look in the mirror and misrecognize their virtual
image as their actual self, so under conditions of ideology individuals
misrecognize socially produced virtual representations as their actual
self. *See also* [[hegemony]];
