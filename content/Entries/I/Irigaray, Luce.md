[[Irigaray, Luce]] 

(1932--) French feminist theorist. Born in Belgium, Irigaray took her Master's
degree in philosophy followed by a doctorate in linguistics. While she
was writing her first doctorate, she taught at the University of Paris
Vincennes (from 1970--4). Her second doctorate, *Speculum de l'autre
femme* (1974), translated as *Speculum of the Other Woman* (1985), which
inaugurated a radical break with Lacan, led to her dismissal from
Vincennes. Since 1980 Irigaray has been at the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique in Paris.
In interviews, which rarely dwell on the personal, Irigaray describes
her work as having gone through three distinct phases: first, she set
out to critique the way the western subject was formed in the image of
the white male and viewed the entire world through that lens; then she
began to think about the ways and means by which a specifically female
subjectivity might be articulated; and, finally, but still ongoing, she
started to think about new models for relations between the sexes not
built on the idea of domination and submission.
In the first phase, Irigaray mobilized
[[deconstruction]] reading
strategies to expose the narrow way in which the subject is conceived.
Mindful of the fact that it is impossible---at least from a
deconstructive perspective---to create a position that is completely
pure, which is to say uncontaminated by the phallogocentrism she wants
to escape, Irigaray advocates a [[strategic essentialism]] of the
feminine.
In the second phase, Irigaray used body morphology as a rhetorical
weapon against anatomy, aiming to reconceive the body (particularly the
female body) as a positivity rather than a lack. It was in this phase
that she famously proposed the image of the lips (by which she means
both the mouth and the labia) as a sex which is neither singular nor
plural (see *Ce Sexe qui n'en est pas un* (1977), translated as *This Sex Which is Not One* (1985)). She has been accused of biological
essentialism for this move, but such a criticism misses the point that
what is at stake is the elaboration of a female
[[imaginary]] (in Lacan's
sense) that does not reduce the female sex to either a weaker version of
the phallus (the clitoris) or that which completes the phallus (the
vagina).
The third, ongoing phase, has been marked by an attempt to mobilize the
polymorphically perverse body of the pre-oedipal subject (to use
[[Freud, Sigmund]]'s famous
description) in order to think about the inherently destabilizing
[[Other]] to the white male
standard around which western subjectivity is conceived. Irigaray does
not conceive the pre-oedipal in a nostalgic fashion, but sees it rather
as the constant potential of all subjects. Involved, too, is the
rethinking of the relation between mother and daughter (which is also
central to [[relativism]]'s
work).
Beyond this, drawing on the work of [[Levinas, Emmanuel]], Irigaray has
attempted to construct an ethics of sexual difference. Not forgetting
her training in linguistics, in *J'aime Ã  toi* (1992), translated as *I love to you* (1996), Irigaray locates the root of the problem posed by
ethics in language itself and shows the way various languages
subordinate women in their very structure.
In her more recent work, such as *Democracy Begins between Two* (2000),
Irigaray has (in collaboration with the Commission for Equal
Opportunities for the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna) tried to give
her ethical thinking a practical twist. Irigaray is a prolific writer,
with a sometimes difficult or elusive style, who engages the western
philosophical canon in a debate about the place for and of women in
thought, politics, and indeed love.
