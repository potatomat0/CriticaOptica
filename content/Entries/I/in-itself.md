[[in-itself]]

 /for-itself
**(*an sich*/*f√ºr sich*, *en-soi*/*pour-soi*)** In
[[phenomenology]], a
dichotomy distinguishing between the two basic modes of existence, the
difference being the latter form has consciousness and the former does
not. The distinction is central to the work of
[[existentialism]] philosopher
[[Sartre, Jean-Paul]], who
uses it to demonstrate that the being of an object such as a stone is
not of the same variety as the being of a human being. However, for
Sartre, not all human beings have being that is for-itself; this status
must be arrived at via the conscious pursuit of a state of freedom.
