[[id]]

(*das Es*) The part
of psychical apparatus where the
[[instinct]] are located in
[[Freud, Sigmund]]'s
[[topography]]. Freud himself
did not use the term 'id'; it was introduced by his English translator
James Strachey, who also used Latin terms for the other two key
constituents of the psychical apparatus, namely the
[[ego]] and
[[superego]]. Freud borrowed
the concept of the id from German psychiatrist Georg Groddek who, in
turn, most likely adapted the idea from [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]]'s opposition
between the 'I' and the 'it' in *Beyond Good and Evil* (1886). The id is
a reservoir of energy that the other parts of the psychical apparatus
draw on, but must also contain if they are not to be overwhelmed by it.
The id does not understand 'no'; it is the [[pleasure principle]] unconstrained by
the [[reality principle]].
