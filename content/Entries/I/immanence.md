[[immanence]]

 A mode of
philosophy grounded in itself. It rejects the idea of an external or
transcendent ground, but is not thereby
[[anti-foundationalism]].
Spinoza is probably the most important philosopher of immanence---in his
work, God is treated as immanent rather than transcendent, meaning that
God does not sit on high judging humans, rather we are at one with His
substance. In the twentieth century the principal philosopher of
immanence is [[Deleuze, Gilles]]---although he
substitutes being for God, his
[[ontology]] is derived from
Spinoza.
