[[iconography]]

 The field of
art history interested in the analysis of the specific image components
of pictures. The term itself is a neologism constructed from the Greek
words for image and writing, a fact that gives a clue to its main
concern. Art historians like Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky show that
Medieval, Baroque, and Renaissance Christian art use a limited number of
images, which also have a fairly stable set of meanings. In the Romantic
period, forests, mountains, and rivers were used in a similarly iconic
manner to the standard Christian symbols of the previous era.
Identifying these images and their specific, coded meanings, enables
these works to be read. The practice of iconography was popularized by
Dan Brown's bestselling novel *The Da Vinci Code* (2003) in which a
historian deciphers the meaning of several different artworks in order
to solve a mystery.
