[[implied reader]] 

[[Iser, Wolfgang]] 's concept for the
reader a literary work appears to be written for, or seems to invite (as
opposed to the actual reader of the work). The implied reader is assumed
to be both sympathetic and receptive to the text's strategies. By the
same token, the implied reader---in contrast to the actual reader---has
no ideological 'baggage' that might interfere with the text's schemes.
The concept clearly owes a debt to Wayne Booth's prior concept of the
implied author and can be usefully compared to [[Fish, Stanley]]'s later notion of the
[[interpretive community]].

Introduction* (1984).
