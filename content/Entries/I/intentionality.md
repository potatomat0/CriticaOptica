[[intentionality]]

 In
philosophy, the relation between thought and the object in the world
being thought about. So if one is thinking of a car, then it is the
relation between one's thought about that car and the actual car itself.
Intentionality does not only have to be directed towards a solid object;
it can also point towards an idea, or an emotion. Thus, it can also be
thought of as the directedness of consciousness. It does not, however,
refer to the idea of intention as motive for action (e.g. whether
someone's intentions are honourable or not).
