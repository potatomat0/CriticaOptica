[[immaterial labour]]

 A
[[Marxism]] concept
designating a type of labour that produces a nonmaterial good such as a
cultural product, communication, information, or knowledge. The kinds of
productions associated with the so-called creative industry, or the
'knowledge economy' are the result of immaterial labour. [[Hardt, Michael]] and [[Negri, Antonio]] specify two kinds of
immaterial labour: (i) problem-solving or analytic labour of the type we
associate with professional service and management; (ii) affective
labour of the type we associate with the service sector, so-called
because it is the [[affect]]
the staff display in themselves and evince in others that is the primary
form of their labour (the waiter's smile is part of their job, in other
words).
