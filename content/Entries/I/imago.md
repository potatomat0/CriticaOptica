[[imago]]

 Swiss
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Jung, Carl]]'s term for the
unconscious prototypes of its parents the child constructs in order to
mediate between itself and the social environment. It is an unconscious
representation, which may or may not be reflected in reality. The child
may hold the imago of a fierce father, yet in reality its father may be
rather mild. [[Freud, Sigmund]] did not use this
concept. References to it appear in the early work of [[Lacan, Jacques]], but he dropped it
in the 1950s.
