[[Ingarden, Roman]]
(1893--1970) Polish literary theorist who worked on
[[phenomenology]] and had a
significant influence on the establishment of both [[Reception Theory]] and [[Reception Aesthetics]]. Born in Kraków,
then a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Ingarden studied mathematics
in Lviv (in the Ukraine), and philosophy in Göttingen under [[Husserl, Edmund]]. He moved to
Freiburg with Husserl and completed his doctorate on [[Bergson, Henri]] under his
supervision in 1918. He then returned to Poland, teaching first at Lviv
University, until it was closed because of war in 1941, then at the
Nicolaus Copernicus University after the war. Ingarden's career suffered
under communist rule---he was frequently banned from teaching, accused
of being either an idealist or an enemy of materialism. In the early
part of his career, up until the outbreak of World War II, Ingarden
wrote in German as was common, but he switched to Polish out of
solidarity with his invaded homeland. Consequently, it is really only
his early works that are known outside of Poland. Of these early works,
the best known is undoubtedly *Das literarische Kunstwerk. Eine
Untersuchung aus dem Grenzgebiet der Ontologie, Logik und
Literaturwissenschaft* (1931), translated as *The Literary Work of Art*
(1973). This work, which attempts to theorize the ontology of literature
as it is being read, had a significant influence on [[Wellek, René]] and [[Iser, Wolfgang]], particularly the
latter, as well as on the development of [[reader-response criticism]]. Ingarden argues
that neither of the key metaphysical categories of the real and the
ideal is adequate to describe the ontology of the literary work, and
proposes instead that it be understood as a stratified intentional
object.
