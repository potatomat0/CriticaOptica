[[imaginary]]
(***imaginaire***) A concept used by [[Bachelard, Gaston]], [[Lacan, Jacques]], and [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] to indicate (in
their own differing ways) a process of the mind or the psychical
apparatus susceptible to the seductions of the image. For Lacan, the
imaginary is the state or order of mind of the child before it is
inducted into the
[[symbolic]] order via the
process he referred to as the [[mirror stage]]. The child sees itself
in the mirror and
[[ecofeminism]] the image
it sees reflected there as its true self. The 'I' in this sense is an
image, which is to say a product of the imaginary. The imaginary is not
a 'childish' state of mind, it is rather a state of mind ignorant of the
limits of the [[real]] and
therefore highly creative. But it can also be disturbing---the
experience of [[psychosis]]
is akin to being trapped in the imaginary.
