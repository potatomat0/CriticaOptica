[[intentional fallacy]]

 A core
idea of [[New Criticism]]. W.
K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley argue in 'The Intentional Fallacy'
(1954), that the author's intentions---that is, the vision the author
has of what they are trying to achieve in a particular work---are not a
valid basis for critical judgement about a text's relative worth as
literature. Crudely put, the fact that an author thought they were
writing the great realist novel of their time is not sufficient to make
it so. By the same token, just because they failed to realize their
intention to write a great realist novel is no reason to disregard the
work's other potential merits. Rather, one must concentrate on its
formal properties because these and these alone are sufficient to
distinguish good literature from bad. *See also* [affective
fallacy](#X780a53d4aa8ddee23a5bd3f0c7990e01f2a26d0).
