[[intertextuality]] 

[[Kristeva, Julia]]  is generally
credited with the invention of the term, but the concept can also be
found in the work of [[Barthes, Roland]] and [[Jakobson, Roman]]. Derived from a
synthesis of [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]]'s concept of
[[dialogism]] and [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s notion of
[[dreamwork]],
intertextuality is a theory of meaning and meaning-production. It holds
that all texts (in the expanded sense of the term
[[post-structuralism]] theory
maintains) are composed of other (pre-existing) texts (in the ordinary
sense of the word) held together in a state of constant interaction. It
means that there are no original texts, no complete texts and no
singular texts: all texts exist in a state of partiality and
inter-dependency with other texts. This is not simply a fact of
language, according to Kristeva, but its necessary pre-condition. Every
writer is first of all a reader, Kristeva argues, so their works are
created from textual resources they've digested in a lifetime of
reading; by the same token, readers are like writers, they build up a
picture of what they read by associating it with everything they've read
before. Meaning is therefore always 'in between'.
