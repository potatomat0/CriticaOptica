[[identity]]

 The image of who
one is. This may be either a self-composed image, i.e. the image one has
of oneself, or, it may be imposed from the outside, i.e. the image
others have of one. These two images are not always in harmony with one
another. Identity is at stake in questions and problematics to do with
sexuality, [[gender]],
[[race]], and ethnicity.
