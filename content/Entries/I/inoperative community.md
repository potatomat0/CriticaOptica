[[inoperative community]]
**(communauté désœuvrée)** A theory of community put forward by French
philosopher [[Nancy, Jean-Luc]] which rejects the
idea that community can be produced through work. By inoperative
('désoeuvrée') Nancy does not mean dysfunctional or failing, but rather
a spontaneous or 'unworked' inclination to come together that has no
object or purpose other than itself. Community does not confer a higher
purpose upon its constituents, Nancy claims. It does not, as religious,
quasi-religious, and metaphysical philosophers argue (he has in mind
[[Heidegger, Martin]], but one
could also name [[Badiou, Alain]]), transform humans
from animals into men and women. The coming together is not motivated by
individual desire or collective insecurity, but inheres in the human
situation as a passion for sharing. This model of community is
resolutely set in the present and Nancy explicitly rejects those models
of community (particularly Marx-inspired models) that situate community
as either a lost idyll or future ideal that can never be realized.
