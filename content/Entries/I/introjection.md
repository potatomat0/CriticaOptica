[[introjection]]

 The
transposition in fantasy of an
[[object]] or any other
source of [[pleasure]] that
is usually outside the subject to a position inside the subject. For
example, the child may perceive the strength of its father or kindness
of its mother as agreeable attributes and unconsciously incorporate
these into its [[ego]] and
[[superego]]. Consequently,
if one or other parent dies, the work of mourning the subject enters
into is in part a kind of mourning for the loss of a part of the self
too. The concept was conceived as the opposite of the notion of
[[projection]], by [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s friend and fellow
[[psychoanalysis]] Sandor
Ferenczi in 1909; it was adopted by Freud himself in 1915. The concept
is central to the work of [[Klein, Melanie]], though she
restricts its use to the discussion of objects.
