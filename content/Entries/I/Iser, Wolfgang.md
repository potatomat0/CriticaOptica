[[Iser, Wolfgang]] 

(1926--2007)


German literary scholar known for establishing [[Reception Theory]]. Together with his
colleague [[Jauss, Hans Robert]], he is the founder
of the Konstanz School of reception aesthetics which has had a
significant influence on Anglo-American [[reader-response criticism]]. His most
significant books are *Der implizite Leser: Kommunikationsformen des
Romans von Bunyan bis Beckett* (1972), translated as *The Implied
Reader: Patterns of Prose Communication in Prose Fiction from Bunyan to
Beckett* (1974) and *Der Akt des Lesens: Theorie Ã¤sthetischer Wirkung*
(1976), translated as *The Act of Reading* (1978). The concept of the
[[implied reader]] has been
widely used in literary studies. In a marvellous cameo written about
himself in the middle of a textbook published near to the end of his
life entitled *How to do Theory* (2006), Iser explains that his
theoretical explorations arose not from philosophy (although they owe an
obvious and acknowledged debt to
[[phenomenology]]), but out
of a recognition that the study of literature was in a state of crisis
in the 1950s. Cultural heritage, he argues, could no longer serve as the
unquestioned justification for studying literature and readers could no
longer be expected to mine canonical texts for a standard set of
'improving' meanings. Having set aside the idea that all texts contain a
specified set of meanings readers should find, Iser then set about
trying to understand how meanings are in fact formed. His key
publications pertain to this problem.
