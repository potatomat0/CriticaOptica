[[index (semiotic)]] 

In [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]] 's
[[semiotics]], the second
part of his tripartite model of the
[[sign]]'s relation to the
[[object]] (the other two
elements are the [[icon]] and
the [[symbol]]). The index
sign is characterized by the fact that it shows the object---examples
for Peirce include weathervanes, thermometers, yardsticks, and
photographs.
