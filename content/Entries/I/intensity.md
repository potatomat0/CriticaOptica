[[intensity]]

[[Deleuze, Gilles]]'s term, derived
from language philosophy, for the specific criteria that determine that
something is one kind of thing and not another. Because Deleuze uses it
to theorize the ontology of literally everything, including
[[affect]], it is often
mistakenly thought that intensity refers to a species of experience that
is particularly intense. But this is false. The true origin of the term
is the logical relation between intension and extension. If we take the
colour blue as our example, the extension of blue is all the objects in
the world that are blue, while intension is the specific set of
characteristics that make a thing recognizable as blue. In this sense,
intensity may also be understood, paradoxically enough, as the extension
of difference. *See also*
