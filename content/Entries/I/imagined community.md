[[imagined community]]
[[Anderson, Benedict]]'s
definition of nation. In *Imagined Communities* (1983) Anderson argues
that the nation is an imagined political community that is inherently
limited in scope and sovereign in nature. It is imagined because the
actuality of even the smallest nation exceeds what it is possible for a
single person to know---one cannot know every person in a nation, just
as one cannot know every aspect of its economy, geography, history, and
so forth. But as Anderson is careful to point out (contra [[Gellner, Ernest]]) imagined is not
the same thing as false or fictionalized, it is rather the
unselfconscious exercise of abstract thought.
The imagined community is limited because regardless of size it is never
taken to be co-extensive with humanity itself---not even extreme
ideologies such as Nazism, with its pretensions to world dominance,
imagine this; in fact, as [[Agamben, Giorgio]] has argued, such
ideologies tend to be premised on a generalization of an exception. Its
borders are finite but elastic and permeable. The imagined community is
sovereign because its legitimacy is not derived from divinity as
kingship is---the nation is its own authority, it is founded in its own
name, and it invents its own people which it deems citizens. The nation
can be considered a community because it implies a deep horizontal
comradeship which knits together all citizens irrespective of their
class, colour, or race. According to Anderson, the crucial defining
feature of this type of comradeship is the willingness on the part of
its adherents to die for this community.
The nation as imagined community came into being after the dawning of
the age of [[Enlightenment]]
as both a response to and a consequence of secularization. It is the
product of a profound change in the apprehension of the world, which
Anderson specifies as a shift from sacred time to 'homogeneous empty
time', a notion he borrows from [[Benjamin, Walter]]. In sacred time,
present and future are simultaneous. Because everything that occurs is
ordained by God, the event is simultaneously something that has always
been and something that was meant to be. In such a conception of time
there is no possibility of a 'meanwhile', or uneventful event, that is a
mode of time that is empty of meaning rather than full of portent.
Secularization, however, gave prominence to empty time, the time of
calendars, clocks, and markets, which is concerned with temporal
coincidence rather than destiny and fulfilment. This mode of time is
perfectly embodied by the newspaper which places in contiguity news of
events that share only their temporality.
It was the establishment of print culture, firstly through the
mechanical production of Bibles and then even more strongly through the
distribution of newspapers, that was the most important causal factor in
creating the cultural conditions needed for the idea of nation to become
the political norm. Print had three effects according to Anderson:
first, it cut across regional idiolects and dialects, creating a unified
medium of exchange below the sacred language (Latin in Europe) and above
the local vernacular; second, it gave language a fixity it didn't
previously have, and slowed down the rate of change so that there was
far greater continuity between past and present; and thirdly it created
languages of power by privileging those idiolects which were closest to
the written form. Anderson's emphasis on the print culture in all its
forms, but particularly the newspaper and the novel, has been extremely
stimulating for a number of scholars working in a wide variety of
different disciplines. *See also*
