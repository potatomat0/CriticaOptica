[[ideology]]

 A set of beliefs,
convictions or ideas which both binds a particular group of people
together and determines the actions they take. For this reason, ideology
is often used---particularly in the media---as a pejorative, as though
to say only certain types of people have (indeed 'suffer from')
ideology, and it renders them incapable of thinking for themselves. But,
as commentators like [[Jameson, Fredric]] and [[Žižek, Slavoj]] argue, this position
is itself ideological because it is built on the tacit, but obviously
deeply held belief that its own position, i.e. the allegedly
non-ideological position, is the 'normal' or 'commonsense' view of
things, while the so-called ideological position is aberrant. The notion
of a non-ideological position is thus a
[[myth]] or better yet a
[[projection]]. This in turn
points to two other characteristics of ideology: it is frequently
invisible to its adherents and it serves to create rules or regimes of
inclusion and exclusion. Because of its invisibility, ideology is often
equated with [[false consciousness]]. To escape his
censors, the imprisoned Italian
[[Marxism]], [[Gramsci, Antonio]] used the term
[[hegemony]] in place of
ideology and in doing so explained the invisibility of ideology---it is,
he argued, the role of ideology to define and police that which counts
as commonsense, that which everybody knows to be so, and insofar as it
does that it is invisible. The task of any politics, then, according to
Gramsci is to overturn this state of affairs, but not so as to get rid
of ideology altogether---impossible, in any case---but rather to make
way for a new ideology, one which is clear about interests. Marxists
generally refer to this formation of ideology as [[class consciousness]]. Perhaps the
most widely used definition of ideology is the one given by French
Marxist, [[Althusser, Louis]]
who conceived it as an
[[imaginary]] relation to
real conditions.
