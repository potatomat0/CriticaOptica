[[interpretive community]]
[[Fish, Stanley]] developed
this concept to explain how diverse readers consistently produce similar
readings of certain types of texts. His argument, which borrows [[Chomsky, Noam]]'s distinction
between [[over determination]], is that readers
in a particular community at a particular time internalize a set of
expectations about how texts work and what counts as a text, amounting
to a kind of literary competence, such that whenever they encounter a
new text they already know how to respond to it. [[Bourdieu, Pierre]] makes a very
similar argument using his concept of the
[[habitus]].
