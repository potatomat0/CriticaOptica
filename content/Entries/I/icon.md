[[icon]]

 Derived from the Greek
'eik≈çn', meaning 'resemblance' or 'image', it is generally used to refer
to sacred images of Christian saints and other religiously significant
figures. American
[[metafiction]] [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]] adopted
this term as one of three classifications of types of
[[sign]] (the other two being
the [[index (semiotic)]] and the
[[symbol]]). For Peirce, the
icon is an example of what he called firstness because it is able to
signify by virtue of its own qualities (i.e. without reference to an
object or convention). A pure icon in Peirce's sense is an image of a
thing so closely resembling the thing it represents that we forget we
are looking at an image. It is, in this sense, a theoretical
possibility, not an actuality.
