[[Ideological State Apparatus]]
([[ISA]]) French
[[Marxism]] philosopher
[[Althusser, Louis]]'s concept
for what is known in contemporary political discourse as 'soft power',
i.e. the form of power that operates by means of ideological persuasion
rather than violent, physical coercion. The latter 'hard power' form is
referred to as the [[Repressive State Apparatus]]
([[RSA]]). Ideology, for
Althusser, is an essential part of the smooth running of any form of
government, even the most violent and repressive governments, because
without the active support of at least a portion of the general
population it cannot hope to succeed. Power, Althusser argues, does not
only come out of the barrel of a gun (as Mao famously said), but must
also be crystallized in the minds of individual subjects. In so saying,
Althusser separates the state from the apparatuses the state requires in
order to maintain itself, his implication being that revolutionaries not
only need to take power, they also need to control the apparatuses of
power. The Ideological State Apparatus is not unified like the RSA, but
consists rather in a loose coalition of largely private or
nongovernmental entities such as churches, schools, universities, trade
unions, the media, and even the family. Each of these entities is
semi-autonomous, which is to say they have their own area of efficacy
and are not necessarily subordinated in any direct way to a higher
authority. In order to explain this collective but independent acting
together Althusser constructed the notion of [[structural causality]]. Despite their
diversity, all ISAs contribute to a single result, namely the
reproduction of the relations of production. *See also*
