[[ideal ego]] 

(*Idealich*)
The [[ego]]'s
[[narcissism]] and
idealized image of itself as omnipotent. Although
[[Freud, Anna]] did use this
concept in his work on narcissism, it does not figure very largely in
his work. [[anaclisis]]
[[psychoanalysis]],
particularly [[Žižek, Slavoj]], have
found it useful to contrast with the
[[ego-ideal]], and create a
binary between an image others have of the 'I' and the 'I' as it wants
to see itself.
