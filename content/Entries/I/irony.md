[[irony]]

 A type of
[[rhetoric]] in which there
is a deliberate and obvious disparity or incongruity between the
statement made and its intent, as when we say one thing, but mean the
opposite of what we say. When somebody says, 'lovely weather we're
having', and it is raining, they are being ironic. Irony in this sense
is a very close relative of sarcasm. But it can take more complex forms
and its intent does not always have to be humour. For instance, when
Romeo kills himself because he thinks Juliet is dead, that is also
ironic. Literary theory distinguishes at least five types (or
[[trope]]) of irony: (i)
verbal irony---the simplest form involving a discrepancy between
statement and intent (e.g. sarcasm); (ii) structural irony---a more
complex or extended form in which a character's world-view is at odds
with the world they find themselves in (e.g. Sade's *Justine, or Good
Conduct Well Chastised* (1791), which is doubly ironic in that the
author is clearly unsympathetic towards his naive heroine who is
constantly surprised by the cruelties and injustices meted out to her);
(iii) dramatic irony---routinely found in TV sitcoms, it involves a
situation in which the audience possesses more information than the
characters on stage (all pantomimes play on this, with the audience
deriving great amusement from knowing the monster is behind the hero,
who for some reason is unable to see the monster for himself); (iv)
tragic irony---a version of dramatic irony in which the audience can see
that a character's course of action is destined not to have the outcome
the character thinks it will (e.g. Arthur Miller's *Death of a Salesman*
(1949); (v) cosmic irony---a version of dramatic irony in which it seems
that despite the best intentions of characters, fate is always going to
crush their dreams (e.g. Thomas Hardy's *Jude the Obscure* (1895).
