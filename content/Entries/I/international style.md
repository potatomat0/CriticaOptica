[[international style]]

 An
austere, anti-ornamental, ultra
[[modernism]] style of
architecture associated with the work of the great European architects
of the early twentieth century: Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, and Ludwig
Mies van der Rohe, among others. The term derives from the title of an
exhibition (and accompanying book written by Henry Russell Hitchcock and
Philip Johnson) staged in 1932 to showcase a new style of architecture
which emerged after the end of World War I. Characterized by its smooth,
balanced, but not necessarily symmetrical lines, its lack of decorative
flourishes, and its emphasis on volume and preference for cheap modern
materials like steel, glass, and concrete, the international style is
highly distinctive. Mies van der Rohe's most famous quote 'less is more'
could serve as a motto for the style aimed at by the entire movement,
while Le Corbusier's description of buildings as 'machines for living'
perhaps sums up its functionalist attitude---architecture was supposed
to change how people act, think, live, and work. In this sense it was
[[utopia]].
