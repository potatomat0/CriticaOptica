[[Klein, Melanie]] 
(1882--1960)


Austrian-born child
[[psychoanalysis]] and leading
exponent of [[object relations theory]]. She was born in
Vienna into a family of middle-class, non-practising Jews. She married
young, which prevented her from completing her studies at the University
of Vienna. In 1910 she moved with her husband and family to Budapest,
which is where she encountered psychoanalysis for the first time. She
even got to meet [[Freud, Sigmund]] in 1917. She trained
as an analyst with Freud's friend SÃ¡ndor Ferenczi, and began her own
practice in 1919. After meeting Karl Abraham she moved (with his
encouragement) to Berlin in 1921, where she practised for five years.
Due to her rivalry with [[Freud, Anna]], Berlin proved an
unhappy city to practise in, so when Freud's biographer Ernest Jones
suggested she move to London she leapt at the chance. She lived the rest
of her life there and became a central figure in British psychoanalytic
circles. She trained a number of quite eminent psychoanalysts, including
Hanna Segal, Wilfred Bion, and Herbert Rosenfeld. Klein pioneered a form
of 'play therapy' as a way of psychoanalysing children too young to
verbalize their thoughts in feelings the way adults do in the process
Freud called 'free association'. A detailed account of her technique is
given in *Narrative of Child Analysis* (1961), which is an extensive
case history of one patient, known as little Richard or little Dick.
Both [[Lacan, Jacques]] and
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] are highly
critical of Klein's interpretation of her patient's play, pointing out
that she is a little too willing to see children's toys as symbols. Yet,
it also has to be said, both theorists draw on her work for their own
conceptual inventions. Her principal contribution to psychoanalytic
theory is the concept of the
[[part-object]], which is
central to the development of object relations theory. Klein argued that
the child initially perceives its mother as a disconnected series of
part-objects, centring on the breast as its primary source of nutrition.
But the child is
[[ambivalence]] about the
breast because sometimes it gets food from it and sometimes it is denied
food, so it splits the breast into a 'good' object and a 'bad' object.
As the child grows up it has to learn to integrate these two objects and
recognize the mother as a whole person. The former ambivalence induces
feelings of guilt which the child then tries to make reparations for.
This is a constant cycle for Klein.
