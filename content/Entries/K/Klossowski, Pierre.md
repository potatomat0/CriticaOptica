[[Klossowski, Pierre]]
(1905--2001) French philosopher, novelist, and artist, born in Paris.
Klossowski's parents---both of whom were artists, as was his younger
brother Balthus Klossowski, who rose to considerable fame as a painter
(Bono sang at his funeral)---were originally from Poland and probably of
Jewish descent. He travelled a lot with his family in his youth. From
the start of World War I in 1914 until 1923 he lived in Switzerland,
Germany, and Italy. When he returned to Paris in 1923, his mother's
lover the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke arranged a job for him as
private secretary to the French author André Gide who was then working
on his masterpiece *Les Faux-monnayeurs* (1925), translated as *The Counterfeiters* (1931). At the same time he commenced his university
studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. However, he did not
pursue a conventional academic career. Instead he made a precarious
living as a freelance critic and translator. This brought him into
contact with a number of the leading thinkers of the 1920s and
1930s---[[Bataille, Georges]]
and [[Benjamin, Walter]]
(whose works he translated into French) numbered among his close
friends. During World War II, Klossowski spent his time in a seminary
training to be a Catholic priest, but he did not complete his training
and lost his vocation, which inspired his first novel *La Vocation
suspendue* (Suspended Vocation, 1950). It is for his work on Sade,
*Sade, mon prochain* (1947), translated as *Sade My Neighbour* (1991),
and Nietzsche, *Nietzsche et le cercle vicieux* (1969), translated as
*Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle* (1998), that Klossowski is best
known. The former influenced [[Barthes, Roland]], [[Beauvoir, Simone de]], [[Blanchot, Maurice]], and [[Foucault, Michel]], each of whom
would add their own contributions to the growing catalogue of works
devoted to Sade (a measure of his lasting influence may be seen in Pier
Paolo Pasolini's acknowledgement of him in the credits to his 1975 film
*Salò*), while the latter would prove especially significant to [[Deleuze, Gilles]], with whom
Klossowski would also become friends, and [[Lyotard, Jean-François]]. After 1970
Klossowski stopped writing and concentrated on drawing.
