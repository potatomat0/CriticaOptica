[[Kant, Immanuel]] 
(1724--1804)


German philosopher, one of the most influential thinkers of all time.
His influence is so great, European philosophy is generally divided into
pre-Kantian and post-Kantian schools of thought. Outside of philosophy,
Kant's essays on the
[[sublime]] and the meaning
of [[Enlightenment]] have
been hugely influential in setting the agenda for research in
aesthetics.
Kant was born in KÃ¶nigsberg, then the capital of Prussia, but now a
Russian exclave---it was renamed Kaliningrad at the end of World War II
when the city was occupied by Soviet forces. Even by the standards of
his own time, Kant was extremely unworldly: he never travelled more than
100 miles from his hometown, and almost his entire professional life was
spent as a university academic.
In 1781 he published *Kritik der reinen Vernunft* (1781), translated as
*Critique of Pure Reason* (1929), the work which established him as one
of the greatest philosophers of all time. Kant himself described the
work as producing the philosophical equivalent of the so-called
Copernican Revolution because it reversed the usual assumption that the
apprehension of empirical sense-data necessarily precedes the production
of the concepts we assign to them.
*Critique of Pure Reason*, or the First Critique, as it is usually known
because it was followed by two further critiques, sought to overcome
what Kant saw as the problem of the
[[empiricism]] David Hume's
scepticism concerning causation. He agreed with Hume that it is
impossible to prove that every event has a cause by power of experience,
but disagreed with him that one should thereby abandon the general
principle that every event has a cause. Kant's solution is to divide the
psychical apparatus in two: on the one side there are 'intuitions', the
perceptions of given sense data, and on the other side there are
categories and concepts (such as space and time), the universal laws of
the mind. His rationale is that we could not describe the world in a
variety of different ways if we did not have concepts that enable us to
see it differently too. But even more importantly, Kant argued that even
when a specific cause is not perceptible we nonetheless know that it
must exist and that necessity is sufficient to found knowledge.
Kant describes the process of attaining knowledge as judgement and
identifies three stages in its composition: first there is the
apprehension of something that affects the mind, then the imagination
reproduces it in the mind, and thirdly it is recognized by the mind
which assigns it a concept. Judgement is the application of the rules of
understanding to intuitions. These rules are said to be 'transcendental'
by Kant because they function as conditions of possibility for
knowledge. In the subsequent Second and Third Critiques, *Kritik der
praktischen Vernunft* (1788), translated as *Critique of Practical
Reason* (1909), and *Kritik der Urteilskraft* (1790), translated as *The Critique of Judgement* (1952), Kant turned his attention to aesthetic,
moral, and political questions. Such is the force of these later works
Kant is regarded by many readers as fundamentally a moral philosopher.
As a moral philosopher, Kant is austere and uncompromising: the only act
that is unconditionally good in his view is one that is done selflessly
out of a sense of duty and for the sake of duty. Acting out of duty
deprives the will (or what after
[[Freud, Anna]] we would call the
[[ego]]) of an
[[object]] of
[[desire]], meaning that the
act is carried out in accordance with universal law rather than for
personal gain. His ethics are developed on the principle that they must
not presuppose a specific object or will, but must always reflect
universal laws, or what Kant called the 'categorical imperative', which
is a law that any rational being would recognize as valid without
exception in all imaginable situations.
