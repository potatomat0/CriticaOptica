[[Kautsky, Karl]] 
(1854--1938)


Marxist intellectual and political activist. He was born in Prague, but
his family moved to Vienna when he was 7 years old. He studied history,
economics and philosophy at the University of Vienna. It was there that
his active involvement with politics began. He joined the Austrian
Social Democratic Party. In 1881 he visited [[Engels, Friedrich]] in London and the
two became firm friends. In Stuttgart in 1883 he founded the journal
*Die Neue Zeit* (The New Time), and edited it until 1917, which provided
him with a basic means of living, even while living abroad, as he
frequently did. Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the First World War.
After the November Revolution in Germany (the chaotic period from the
end of the First World War in November 1918 until the establishment of
the Weimar Republic in August 1919), he was given a senior position in
the Foreign Office of the briefly reigning revolutionary government,
which he used to try to prove Germany's war guilt. A prolific author, he
wrote a biography of Engels as well as a detailed account of
[[Marxism]]'s economic theory.
His writings were held in high enough regard in his own lifetime to
attract strong (negative) responses from both Lenin and Trotsky.

[[khōra]] **(chora)** The
pre-linguistic or inchoate point of origin of the subject, for which the
womb may stand as a figure, though the pre-biotic soup out of which all
life is supposed to have emerged according to evolutionary theory might
stand just as well. Paris-based, Bulgarian linguist and psychoanalyst
[[Kristeva, Julia]] adapted
the term from Plato's *Timaeus*, where it means quite simply a
receptacle for meaning, to theorize a semiotic network or nonexpressive
totality out of which individual words and meanings are produced. It is
for her the potentiality for meaning that must pre-exist meaning-making,
but it has no meaning itself. It is in this respect neither sensible nor
intelligible, although Kristeva insists it is nonetheless regulated and
not anarchic as [[Derrida, Jacques]] charges in his
account of the concept. As the potential for meaning, the *khōra* is
also the limit or disruption of meaning. It makes its appearance then
wherever meaning-production is pushed to its limits, as in modern and
postmodern art and literature. In
[[psychoanalysis]] terms, the
*khōra* is the realm of the
[[drive]], which are
pre-symbolic, unrepresentable, yet motivating: they give the subject the
energy they need to act.
