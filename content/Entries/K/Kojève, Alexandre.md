[[Kojève, Alexandre]]
(1902--68) Russian philosopher and political theorist. The nephew of the
Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, Kojève had a privileged upbringing in
pre-revolutionary Russia. In 1918 he was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks
for small-time black market activities. He was duly released, but
because he was unable to further his studies under the new regime, he
fled to Poland. From there he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, where he
studied with [[Husserl, Edmund]], and [[Jaspers, Karl]]. He started
reading [[genre]] then, but
would later claim that he could not (at that point) make head or tail of
it. He soon moved on again, this time to Paris, where he was to spend
the rest of his life. There he met his countryman Alexandre Koyré, whose
lectures he attended along with [[Bataille, Georges]]. In 1933, at
Koyré's invitation, Kojève commenced lecturing on Hegel's religious
philosophy at École Pratique des Hautes Études. Among the regular
attendees was
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Lacan, Jacques]],
[[Surrealism]] Raymond
Queneau (who would later edit the lectures and publish them) and [[Breton, André]], and the
philosophers [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]] and Eric
Weil. Accordingly it is generally said that Kojève taught the French how
to read Hegel. Influenced by his friend and mentor Koyré, Kojève
emphasized the importance of Napoleon's victory at Jena to Hegel,
claiming this episode was the embodiment of Hegel's thesis concerning
the 'end of history' in which the
[[dialectic]] of master and
slave is finally transcended. He later corrected this claim by saying
Hegel was premature in his pronouncement by a century and that it was in
fact Stalin who most perfectly realized this thesis, only to renounce it
a few years later and revert to his original position. For Kojève the
end of history arrives with the advent of the universal and the
homogenous. Initially he thought this was realized in communism, but he
subsequently changed his mind and saw that it is actualized fully in the
abundance of American-style capitalism. Kojève's most famous work was
*Introduction à la 'Phenoménologie de l'esprit'* (1947), translated as
*Introduction to the Reading of Hegel* (1980). After the war, at the
invitation of one of his former students Robert Marjolin he joined the
Ministry of Finance and worked as an adviser in the international trade
section, though he continued to write as well and engaged in a famous
debate with the American conservative philosopher [[Strauss, Leo]]. *See also*
