[[Koyré, Alexandre]]
(1892--1964) Russian-born French philosopher and science historian. The
son of middle-class importers, Koyré was born in Taganrog in Southern
Russia. As a teenager, he took part in the political activities of the
failed 1905 revolution, for which he was briefly imprisoned. At 17, he
went to Göttingen in Germany to study with [[Husserl, Edmund]] and from there to
Paris to work with Léon Brunschvicg. He also attended the lectures of
[[Bergson, Henri]], then one
of the most famous philosophers in France---Koyré would later be the
first philosopher to introduce Bergson's work in Germany. He was also
instrumental in introducing Husserl's thought into France. When war
broke out in 1914, he returned to Russia and joined the infantry. He
took part in the unsuccessful February Revolution in 1917, but opposed
the successful October Revolution in the same year. He left Russia
permanently in 1919, settling in France where he resumed his studies in
philosophy. He taught religion and philosophy at the Fifth Section of
the École Pratique des Hautes Études from 1931 onwards. In the academic
year of 1932--3, Koyré wrote a series of articles and lectures to mark
the centenary of [[genre]]'s
death. He then took a job teaching in Cairo, which gave his friend and
fellow Russian [[Kojève, Alexandre]] an opportunity to
teach in his place. In his work, Koyré emphasized the significance of
the Napoleonic wars to Hegel in the so-called Jena period during which
he wrote *Phänomenologie des Geistes* (1807). Koyré argued that if a
Hegelian mode of history is possible, then it is conditioned on the
possibility of history being able to come to an end. Napoleon's victory
at Jena was one such moment because in Hegel's view it precipitated the
end of the old order of the world and ushered in a new order for which a
new philosophy was required. It was a provocative thesis and one that
profoundly influenced a number of scholars, particularly Kojève. During
the Second World War he took refuge in New York, introducing fellow
exiles and future collaborators [[Jakobson, Roman]] and [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] to one
another.
