[[Kuhn, Thomas Samuel]]
(1922--96) American historian and philosopher of science. Born in
Cincinnati, Kuhn obtained his Bachelor of Science, Master of Science,
and PhD in physics from Harvard University. He taught the history of
science at Harvard from 1948 until 1956. He then moved to California for
a few years before returning (via Princeton) to take up a position at
[[ANT]]
(Massachusetts
Institute of Technology). His most famous work, *The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions*, was published in 1962. Kuhn argued against [[Popper, Karl]]'s thesis that
scientific knowledge progresses in a linear fashion via the progressive
repudiation of thoughts, models, and ideas. Popper believed that
science's true concern is not with 'what is', but rather with what can
be proven false or impossible. In contrast, Kuhn argued that science
proceeds via 'paradigm shifts' (comparable to
[[archaeology]]'s concept of
the [[epistemological break]], though much narrower
in scope) amounting to wholesale revolutions in thought. His rationale
is that some scientific discoveries do not merely refute previous
theories, they redraw the map of knowledge itself---for example, when
Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic he not only proved once
and for all that to do so did not risk falling off the edge of the
earth, he also created a vast new colonial enterprise. Kuhn proposed a
three-phase model of scientific progress: first there is prescience,
which follows certain discoveries, but lacks an overall hypothesis; then
there is 'normal science' in which the initial discoveries are converted
into a paradigm or platform of thought upon which future work can be
built; the third phase is crisis, which is what happens when the second
phase ultimately fails. The crisis is resolved with the irruption of a
new paradigm in the place of the old. Kuhn maintained that each new
paradigm was incommensurable with what went before, but this has since
been rejected as unnecessarily relativistic.
