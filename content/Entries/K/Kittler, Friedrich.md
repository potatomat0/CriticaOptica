[[Kittler, Friedrich]]
(1943--2011) German media theorist born in Rochlitz. His family moved to
Lahr in 1958 to escape from East Germany. He went to University in
Freiburg, studying Romance philology, German studies, and philosophy. He
completed his doctorate on Swiss author and poet Conrad Ferdinand Meyer
in 1976 and his habilitation on modern German literary history in 1984.
He worked at Kassel University and the Ruhr University between 1986 and
1993. In 1993 he was appointed to the chair of media aesthetics and
history at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Influenced by the work of
[[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Foucault, Michel]], and [[Lacan, Jacques]], and writing against
the [[hermeneutics]]
conventions embodied in the work of [[Gadamer, Hans-Georg]], Kittler developed
a discourse analysis of media history that focuses on the fact of media
technology, rather than its specific content. In contrast to [[McLuhan, Herbert Marshall]], Kittler did not
treat media as a prosthetic extension of 'man', but rather argued that
media---or, the inscription system (*Aufschreibesysteme*) as he called
it---creates the necessary conditions in which 'man' can come into
being. Kittler's most well-known works in English are *Discourse Networks 1800/1900* (1990) and *Gramophone Film Typewriter* (1999).
