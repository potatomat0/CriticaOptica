[[Kracauer, Siegfried]]
(1889--1966) German cultural critic, journalist, and film theorist.
Jewish, Kracauer was part of the talented intellectual diaspora that
fled to the United States to escape the Nazis. Although never part of
the inner circle of the [[Frankfurt School]], he was close friends
with two of its core members, [[Adorno, Theodor]] and [[Löwenthal, Leo]].
Born in Frankfurt am Main, Kracauer originally trained as an architect,
writing a doctorate on ornamental metalwork in Berlin and Potsdam. He
worked as an architect until 1917 when he was drafted into the army. He
tried to return to his profession after the war, but it proved
impossible and he drifted into writing, eventually joining the editorial
staff of *Frankfurter Zeitung* in 1921 as an arts journalist writing
primarily about film and literature.
*Die Angestellten. Aus dem neuesten Deutschland* (1930), translated as
*The Salaried Masses* (1998), his first academic book, is an
ethnological study (indebted to Max Weber and [[Simmel, Georg]], under whom he
studied) of white-collar workers in Berlin, written as though they were
representatives of 'primitive tribes' whose habits were foreign and
strange. An early and important but underrated attempt to think and
write about [[everyday life]], *The Salaried Masses*
anticipates the critical sociological work of the Frankfurt School's
Institute for Social Research under [[Horkheimer, Max]].
Between 1921 and 1933 (when he was forced into exile), he wrote over 700
film reviews, as well as hundreds of articles on a wide range of other
cultural topics. He also found time to write a semi-autobiographical
novel, *Ginster* (1928). A sample of these essays is available in *Das Ornament der Masse* (1963), translated as *The Mass Ornament* (1995),
the title of which is taken from his essay on chorus-line dancers. The
collection also contains a fragment of the book *Der Detektiv Roman: Ein
philosophischer Traktat* (The Detective Novel: A Philosophical
Treatise), completed in 1925 but never published in full in his
lifetime. Like [[Bloch, Ernst]], also a
fellow-traveller of the Frankfurt School, Kracauer saw in the detective
novel a microcosm of
[[modernity]].
Like his friend [[Benjamin, Walter]], Kracauer left it
somewhat late to escape Europe but happily, whereas the former did not
make it, he did, though his family were not so fortunate. With the
assistance of the Institute for Social Research he managed to get to the
US in 1941 and at the age of 51 had to start all over again. He made
ends meet writing for *The Nation*, *Harper's Magazine*, and *The New
York Times Book Review*, as well as reports for government agencies like
UNESCO. He was given a job as film curator at New York's Museum of
Modern Art, which gave his life some measure of stability and enabled
him to complete his most ambitious and best-known work, *Theory of Film:
The Redemption of Physical Reality* (1960), which was written in
English.
*Theory of Film* ranks with *What is Cinema?* (1958) by [[Bazin, André]], as one of the
pioneering works of cinema studies. Kracauer theorized that film was at
once part of modernity, which for him meant socially-fragmenting change,
and a possible source of redemption: the cinematic image was capable of
providing a [[utopia]] image
of totality which society itself was unable to do. But this image was to
be grasped only by a close analysis of the micrological details of the
film.
As Miriam Hansen puts it in her excellent introduction to the Princeton
edition of *Theory of Film*, Kracauer's work has fallen into relative
neglect in recent years because his emphasis on the connection between
film and reality does not accord with cinema studies' interest in
virtuality. That said, the journals *New German Critique* (1991) and
*New Formations* (2007) have devoted special issues to Kracauer's work
suggesting a renaissance may be in the wind.
