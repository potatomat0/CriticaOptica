[[Kristeva, Julia]]
 (1941--)


Bulgarian-born, Paris-based linguist, philosopher, and psychoanalyst.
One of the most significant feminist authors in the latter half of the
twentieth century, Kristeva's career seems to fall into three distinct
periods, each distinguished by a different primary interest:
[[post-structuralism]]
linguistics,
[[psychoanalysis]], and
critical biography. These shifts of interest are not so much departures
as stepping stones toward an ever more sophisticated theorization of
language, desire, and the unconscious. She was awarded the prestigious
Holberg Prize in 2004.
Kristeva came to Paris to study in 1965 and enrolled in [[Barthes, Roland]]'s seminars.
Already very well versed in Eastern European linguistics and philosophy,
particularly the work of the [[Russian Formalism]] and [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]], she gave seminar
presentations that helped introduce this work in France. Perceiving the
limits of [[structuralism]]
as a methodology, Kristeva used Bakhtin's work to endow it with a sense
of dynamism and history that it so critically lacked. In 1966, in a
famous essay for the French journal *Communication* (later incorporated
into *Séméiotiké* (1969), partially translated as *Desire in Language*
(1980), she proposed the concept of
[[intertextuality]] to
explain the interconnectedness of all aspects of communication.
Consistent with Bakhtin's notion of
[[dialogism]],
intertextuality holds that there are no intrinsic meanings, that rather
all meaning is produced in a negotiation between previously established
meanings. She found inspiration for her theory in modernist authors,
particularly Louis-Ferdinand Céline, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. Her
teacher, Roland Barthes, adopted the concept of intertextuality in his
*S/Z* (1970), as did her contemporary [[Derrida, Jacques]].
In 1965 she joined the [[Tel Quel]] group, a small band of
philosophers and thinkers (among them Barthes, Derrida and
[[Klossowski, Pierre]]) who wrote for
and identified with the journal of that name founded and edited by her
then husband [[Sollers, Philippe]]. Kristeva
participated in the 1974 *Tel Quel* study trip of China, then in the
grip of the 'Cultural Revolution', following the group's conversion to
Maoism in the late 1960s, and afterwards wrote a highly idealized
account of Chinese life, *About Chinese Women* (1986). Throughout this
period, Kristeva undertook psychoanalytic training, eventually attaining
the status of analyst in 1979. She attempted to blend her interests in
politics, semiotics, and psychoanalysis by synthesizing a new
methodology she christened
[[semanalysis]]. Out of this
work arose the influential concept of the
[[khōra]], which is a
pre-linguistic, pre-subjective realm of psychosexual development.
As the 1970s unfolded, Kristeva drifted away from the *Tel Quel* group
and began to focus more on psychoanalysis. She wrote a trilogy of
studies on [[abject]],
love, and depression: *Powers of Horror* (1982), *Tales of Love* (1983),
and *Black Sun* (1987). The focus of her work is consistently the
situation of the subject and its relation to itself and others.
Beginning in the late 1980s Kristeva worked on a trilogy on the theme of
'female genius', writing comprehensive critical biographies of [[Arendt, Hannah]], Collette, and
[[Klein, Melanie]]. As much
feminist acts of historical recovery as demonstrations of psychoanalytic
prowess, these works seem to portend a move beyond strictly academic
work into a more 'pop' philosophical realm aimed at a broad readership.
She has also written a number of semi-autobiographical works, starting
with *Les Samouraïs* (1990), which are for the post-structuralist
generation what [[Beauvoir, Simone de]]'s works were for
the [[existentialism]]. *See also* [[Cixous, Hélène]];
[[Irigaray, Luce]].
