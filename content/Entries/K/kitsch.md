[[kitsch]]

 Bad, tasteless,
flashy, and commercialized art. It is art that tends to fall into the
paradoxical category of work that we love to hate, or perhaps more
precisely that we love and hate at the same time. Where
[[modernism]] art emphasized
uniqueness, durability, originality, and novelty, kitsch celebrates
mimicry, expendability, repetition, and banality, and finding pleasure
amidst the dross (probably no current artist better exemplifies this
approach than Quentin Tarantino, whose films are a deliberate and
respectful [[pastiche]] of
older styles). The ultimate kitsch item is a replica of a famous
original of the type [[Eco, Umberto]] decries in his account
of [[hyperreality]]. The
[[Frankfurt School]],
particularly [[Adorno, Theodor]], used the term
'kitsch' in conjunction with
[[avant-garde]] to define the
polar extremes of contemporary art, condemning kitsch on the one hand
for merely reproducing the values of [[late capitalism]] and praising the
avant-garde on the other hand for challenging or refusing those values.
Writing in the 1950s and 1960s, Clement Greenberg adopted a similar
binary in his writings on modern art, again condemning kitsch for its
failure to yield anything new or interesting. Although kitsch is
generally used in a derogatory fashion, it can also be used in an
affirmative sense when it refers to items of nostalgia---propaganda
items from former communist countries like China and Russia might be
considered 'good' kitsch because to people on the Left they recollect a
'lost' world of socialist dreams and to people on the Right they confirm
capitalism's victory. Similarly, artists like Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons
exploit nostalgic kitsch in their work.
