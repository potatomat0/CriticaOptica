[[analytic philosophy]]

 A
catch-all phrase designating a variety of different types of work that
have in common their opposition to continental philosophy,
[[metaphysics]], and all
post-Kantian thought (including [[critical theory]]). Often known as
Anglo-American philosophy because it originated in Britain at the turn
of the twentieth century with the work of Bertrand Russell, Alfred North
Whitehead, and G. E. Moore (all of whom were influenced in this
direction by the work of the German logician [[Frege, Gottlob]]), and because its
practice tends to be confined to Anglophone countries, analytic
philosophy is primarily interested in logic. It is suspicious of
language's ability to mislead and misdirect via
[[rhetoric]], so it aims to
find a logical core to its operations and thereby eliminate its power to
obfuscate. It does this by converting all statements into their
propositional form; where this proves impossible, it detects fuzzy
thinking and falsehood. *See also*

positivism](#X8827f5530ec79bfa6720ebbf9487f093cdd6808).
