[[actant]]

 A logical category
in the narrative grammar devised by the Paris-based, Lithuanian linguist
[[Greimas, Algirdas Julien]].
The actant is in Greimas's language an isotope of the action. This means
narrative analysis occurs at a level below that of character and indeed
of character type. Thus to take one very restricted example, if
detective fiction can be understood as a battle between doing good and
doing evil then good and evil actants are required by the narrative
structure. The obvious implication of this insight is that the detective
can be a man, woman, child, alien, good or bad, all without altering the
formal structure of the narrative. Moreover, multiple characters may
fulfil the various actants each narrative type requires. For Greimas,
the actual detective is an
[[actor]], not an actant: the
actant operates at a level below character, and tends to coincide more
with what is usually known as
[[ideology]]. The redemption
of the good is the actual narrative enacted through the detective
bringing a killer to justice. This deep structural approach enables the
inner tensions in narratives, which make them interesting to us, to be
articulated. Along the same lines, Greimas proposed a [[semiotic square]] as a means of mapping
out these tensions and showing how they interact with one another.
