[[Anderson, Perry]]
 (1938--)


British [[Marxism]] historian
and leading exponent of [[historical materialism]]. Few (if any)
scholars display a comparable grasp of both the broad sweep of world
history and its finer nation-specific details, and fewer still have his
command of the vast literature---in several European languages---devoted
to the subject. A prolific essayist, Anderson has written about an
astonishing range of subjects. It was his early essays on British
national culture (which became part of what is now known as the
Nairn-Anderson theses) that propelled him into mainstream attention.
These essays, particularly 'Origins of the Present Crisis' (1964) and
'Components of a National Culture' (1968), both since republished in his
*English Questions* (1992), display Anderson at his uncompromising best.
Treating the UK as a foreign country, they lacerate their subject matter
with the clinical incisiveness of a scalpel.
The 'Origins of the Present Crisis' is in many ways a template of work
to come for Anderson in that it laid down a pattern and purpose of
inquiry his later works would follow. He starts out by lamenting the
absence of what he calls a structural analysis (by which he means
historical materialism rather than
[[structuralism]]) of the
present crisis, namely the decline or stagnation of the British economy,
and offers to remedy the situation by offering a sketch of such an
analysis. He argues that any attempt to understand the present that is
not grounded in an understanding of the past will inevitably fall short
of the mark. For Anderson this means grasping the distinctive formation
of capitalism in Britain and the nature of the class structure that
emerged with it. An early, if ambivalent, enthusiast of the work of
[[anarchism]], Anderson focuses
on the development of capitalist
[[hegemony]] in Britain
beginning with the English Civil War (1640--9), which, he argues, lifted
the obstacles to capitalism by opening the way to enclosure, selective
taxation, and monopoly businesses. Anderson is particularly interested
in the way hegemonic power is rooted in the most mundane activities and
manifests itself in apparently innocuous ways, such as a nostalgia for
tradition (including [[invented tradition]] as
[[Hobsbawm, Eric]] would later
argue).
Anderson's first book-length publications were instalments in a
projected but never completed multivolume work on the origins of
capitalism: *Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism* (1974) and *Lineages of the Absolutist State* (1974). His inability to complete the project
can perhaps be read as symptomatic of an intellectual change of heart.
As his later work demonstrates, Anderson lost faith with the Marxist
dictum that one form of society must necessarily give way to another and
that capitalism will inevitably be succeeded by socialism. However, his
political conviction that only a Marxist critique can illuminate the
hidden political dimensions of our times remains undimmed.
*Considerations on Western Marxism* (1976), *Arguments within English
Marxism* (1980)---a book-length defence of Althusser (and of himself for
supporting Althusser) against the anti-theoretical attack by [[Thompson, Edward Palmer]] in *The Poverty
of Theory* (1978)---and especially *In the Tracks of Historical
Materialism* (1983), are all resolutely negative in tone and outlook:
gone is the hope that a radical transition to socialism is just a matter
of time. It would be wrong to describe him as defeatist at this point,
but the defeat of the Left is a topic that weighs heavily on him. He
concluded the decade with two stirringly negative essays (now to be
found in *English Questions*), 'The Figures of Descent' (1987) and 'A
Culture in Contraflow' (1990), that rendered unequivocal his
disappointment with the present state of critical thinking.
The 1990s were relatively fallow years for Anderson: he published only
one new book in that period (as well as several essays subsequently
published in *Spectrum: From Right to Left in the World of Ideas*
(2005)), *The Origins of Postmodernity* (1998), a short history of the
concept of [[postmodernism]]
and an affectionate account of [[Jameson, Fredric]]'s contribution to
it. As the new millennium began, it became clear that Anderson had
simply been schooling himself in preparation for an incredibly ambitious
calling to account of the contemporary world. The first salvo was *The New Old World* (2009), which provides a typically incisive and merciless
account of the history of the formation of the European Union.
Containing essays on the core nations of the EU---France and Germany,
but interestingly not the UK---as well as outliers like Cyprus and
aspirants like Turkey, Anderson's book offers a nearly complete compass
of views without being able to offer any firm conclusions. His
subsequent books on India, *The Indian Ideology* (2012), and the US,
*American Foreign Policy and its Thinkers* (2013), are more incisive
because they are more willing to venture conclusions. Key to both books
is his inquiry into the complexities of national ideology and the way
that in both India and the US it justifies incredible disparities in
wealth and life opportunities.
It could be said that Anderson's most important work goes unseen. As an
editor and publisher, he has almost singlehandedly created a space for
the intellectual Left. In 1962, Anderson took over the editorship of
*New Left Review*, bringing onto the editorial committee future
stalwarts of the *new* New Left such as Tom Nairn, Robin Blackburn,
Juliet Mitchell, Gareth Stedman Jones, Alexander Cockburn, and Peter
Wollen. Under his stewardship *New Left Review* became one of the most
important forums for critical writing on art, history, politics,
literature, and film. The journal took a broad international focus,
exploring in detail the specific historical situations of a wide range
of countries. In particular, it focused on the situation in the Third
World, perceiving there to be greater scope for radical change at the
periphery; it also sought to explore and interrogate the new theories
being produced by Left-oriented scholars such [[Althusser, Louis]], [[Baudrillard, Jean]], and [[Lacan, Jacques]], but pointedly not
[[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], and [[Foucault, Michel]]. In 1970,
Anderson founded New Left Books (now known as Verso) to extend the
project begun with *New Left Review* in book form. Verso is a major
publisher of [[Badiou, Alain]]
and [[Žižek, Slavoj]].
