[[Aboriginality]]
As Bronwyn
Carlson demonstrates in *The Politics of Identity* (2016), Aboriginality
is a highly contested term that has real, material effects.
Aboriginality is a term the Australian government uses to classify
people who are entitled to receive various government benefits made
available to Indigenous people in Australia (housing, healthcare,
education support, and so on). In this sense Aboriginality is used as a
kind of racial litmus test---it amounts to asking if someone is
Aboriginal 'enough'? By the same token, the term has also been used by
the Australian government to justify the exclusion of Aboriginal people
from citizenship and the rights that usually attach to citizenship---in
this sense it amounts to saying someone is too Aboriginal. For example,
Aboriginality justified the shameful practice of removing Aboriginal
children from their birth families and placing them with white foster
families, which created what is now known as the 'stolen generation'.
Marcia Langton has tried to reclaim the term for critical theory by
using it to conceptualize the disparity between representations of
Indigenous Australians in film and media and their actual life
circumstances. Aboriginality, like [[Said, Edward]]'s term
[[Orientalism]], on which she
models it, seeks to expose the underlying assumptions and prejudices
guiding the depictions of Indigenous Australians made by white
Australians. Moreover, it is concerned to show the 'real-world' effects
these depictions have in shaping policy and hence the daily lives of
Indigenous Australians.
