[[Auerbach, Eric]] 
(1892--1957)


German literary critic and philologist. Along with Ernst Robert Curtius
and Leo Spitzer he is generally regarded as one of the greatest
exponents of [[philology]] of
the twentieth century. He is best known for his magisterial survey of
[[realism]] in western
literature, *Mimesis* (1946), which he wrote---famously---in exile in
Istanbul without access to a library equipped for the study of European
literature. Although his first degree was in law, he decided to pursue a
career in literature and completed a doctorate in 1921 on Romance
literatures. In 1929 he was appointed professor of philology at Marburg
University and in the same year published his first book, a study of the
Italian poet Dante entitled *Dante als Dichter der irdischen Welt*,
translated as *Dante: Poet of the Secular World* (2007). As a Jew he was
obliged to give up his post as a professor in 1935 and then for safety's
sake to leave Germany in 1936. He relocated to Istanbul, where he
remained until 1947; then he moved to the US, where he held positions at
Pennsylvania State University, Princeton, and Yale. Auerbach was
primarily a medievalist and it is in that field where his work has been
the most influential. He was not a literary theorist and as a result
since the advent of
[[structuralism]] his work
has fallen into a state of relative neglect.
