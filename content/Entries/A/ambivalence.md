[[ambivalence]]

 The
co-existence of contradictory feelings or impulses toward the same
[[object]]. [[Freud, Sigmund]] adapted the term
from Eugen Bleuler's groundbreaking work on schizophrenia, *Dementia praecox oder der Gruppe der Schizophrenien* (1911), translated as
*Dementia praecox or the group of schizophrenias* (1950), to account for
a commonly experienced problem in the
[[transference]] process
known as resistance. Freud noted that in some cases, the analysand's
affection for their analyst is also the reason they do not trust them
and are unable to establish a proper therapeutic relationship.
Ambivalence is also exhibited in those stages of sexual development when
the libidinal and destructive tendencies toward an object operate side
by side, as in the sadistic phases. [[object relations theory]], especially child
psychoanalyst [[Klein, Melanie]], make extensive use
of the concept to theorize the genesis of the mature
[[ego]]. Klein theorizes that
the child perceives every object ambivalently because this is what their
experience teaches---the breast does not always produce milk, so it is
at once a good object and a bad object. How the child deals with this
will determine what kind of an adult they turn out to be. In
[[Postcolonial Studies]]
ambivalence has been used by critics like [[Bhabha, Homi]] to account for the
difficult situation of the
[[subaltern]] subject torn
between the material benefits colonization sometimes brings (e.g., jobs
in colonial administration) and the crushing weight of the loss of
national sovereignty.
