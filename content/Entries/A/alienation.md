[[alienation]]
**(*Entfremdung*)** [[Marx, Karl]] used this term to
describe the changes in the economic and social conditions of
[[modernity]] which separated
(i.e., *alienated*) workers from the product of their labour, the
process of their labour, the reason for their labour, and finally each
other. A factory worker in a car manufacturing plant is responsible for
only one small part of the final product, and that may even be invisible
in the finished item; the workers do not control the flow of work, but
have to adapt themselves to the demands of the production line (Henry
Ford famously didn't allow toilet breaks!); moreover, whether there is
in fact any work at all is completely beyond their control, it all
depending on the global market; from this point of view, the workers in
one plant benefit when workers in plants elsewhere fail. Compare this to
the peasant farmer who is responsible for planting, tending and
harvesting his or her crop and works as much or as little as his or her
needs dictate. Marx develops this concept in the posthumously published
'Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts' (1844) by reworking
[[genre]]'s concept of
*Geist* (spirit).
