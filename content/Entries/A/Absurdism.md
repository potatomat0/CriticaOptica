[[Absurdism]]
A term created by
theatre critic Martin Esslin in his 1961 book, *The Theatre of the
Absurd*, to encompass a wide range of works produced in the two decades
after World War II which seem to dramatize Albert Camus' philosophical
position in *Le Mythe de Sisyphe* (1942), translated as *The Myth of
Sisyphus* (2005), that life is inherently absurd. Esslin identified
Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov, later
adding Harold Pinter to the list, as authors whose work typifies what he
means by absurd. Although the work of these authors varies quite widely,
it shares in common the creation of impossible situations, wordplay, and
a pervasive but indefinable sense of menace coupled with seemingly
random explosions of violence. The absurd is closely related to the work
of the [[catharsis]] and
[[Surrealism]]; it also
claims Alfred Jarry's notion of
[[â€™pataphysics]] and [[Artaud, Antonin]]'s [[Theatre of Cruelty]] as its precursors.
Although the term was originally conceived to describe theatrical
productions, its use has grown more general to encompass a wide range of
texts sharing the same qualities. Outside the theatre, the work of Czech
writer Franz Kafka would certainly qualify as Absurdist, as would the
work of Polish author Witold Gombrowicz. But it is not just a literary
or 'high art' phenomenon. Today, one could point to *The Simpsons* and
*South Park* as continuing examples of what Absurdism might mean.
Certainly, Homer Simpson's great line 'It's funny because it's true' is
utterly Absurdist in spirit.
