[[archive]]

 The general horizon
or frame of what French historian [[Foucault, Michel]] called
[[archaeology]] analysis.
The archive is a generic term for the limit of what can be known about a
particular moment or period in history. In itself it consists of
[[discursive practice]], by
which Foucault means the anonymous rules of language, economics,
history, society that taken together enable a culture to function. By
its nature, however, it is never fully available for inspection. Indeed,
Foucault quite categorically states that the archive of one's own time
is unknowable. Thus, both our knowledge of it and our ability to
describe it will only ever be fragmentary at best. In *Mal d'archive:
une impression freudienne* (1995) translated as *Archive Fever: A
Freudian Impression* (1998), [[Derrida, Jacques]] explores the
limits of the knowability of the archive that is our personal history.
