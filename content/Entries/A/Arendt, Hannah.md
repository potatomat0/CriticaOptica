[[Arendt, Hannah]] 
(1906--75)


German-Jewish political philosopher best known for her thesis that evil
is ultimately banal. Born in Hanover, she grew up in KÃ¶nigsberg
(birthplace of [[Kant, Immanuel]]), and studied
philosophy in Marburg under [[Heidegger, Martin]], with whom she
famously had an affair. After breaking up with him, she moved to
Heidelberg and completed her doctorate under the supervision of [[Jaspers, Karl]]. She fled Germany
in 1933, first to Paris where she met [[Benjamin, Walter]], and then to the
US. She returned to Germany after the war, but soon returned to the US.
In 1959 she became the first woman to be appointed full professor at
Princeton University. Her reputation was established with *The Origins
of Totalitarianism* (1951), which sought to set Nazism and Stalinism in
historical context and show how genocidal political systems are able to
gain traction in the public sphere. Her particular concern was to make
apparent the fate of stateless peoples: she had in mind those people,
like the Jews in Germany, who have had their citizenship revoked by the
state; but also those displaced persons who find they cannot return to
their state because it has been destroyed or somehow rendered closed to
them. The Italian philosopher [[Agamben, Giorgio]] has developed this
aspect of Arendt's work in his analyses of what he calls the [[homo sacer]]. Probably her most
influential work, *The Human Condition* (1958) pursued the problems
raised in the previous work by examining political action, specifically
the establishment of rights. She gained public notoriety in 1963 when
she reported on the Eichmann war crimes trials in Jerusalem for the *New Yorker* (later in the same year published in book form as *Eichmann in
Jerusalem*). Eichmann was responsible for a large proportion of the
logistical side of the Holocaust, such as the sourcing, routing, and
timetabling of trains that transported millions of Jews to the death
camps. Her observation that Eichmann was a perfectly ordinary man who
perpetrated monstrous deeds via perfectly ordinary bureaucratic
processes inspired her famous phrase 'the banality of evil'. She
followed this up with the books *On Revolution* (1963) and *On Violence*
(1970).
