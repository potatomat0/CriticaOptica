[[assemblage]]
**(*agencement*)** A concept created by [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] to account for
the complex combination and interaction of a set of material objects,
which may be very diverse and heterogeneous in nature, and a set of
discursive qualities or attributes, which may be similarly diverse in
nature. Deleuze and Guattari used [[Foucault, Michel]]'s work on prisons
as their key exhibit of what they mean by assemblage. The prison
combines the physical structure of the prison itself with its inmates
and guards as well as a host of prison rules, procedures, and practices
that give shape to daily life in the prison. But the prison also taps
into a discursive system of laws as well as ways of thinking about
criminals and criminality that determines not only who should be in
prison, but also for how long and for what reason. The prison and the
justice system (as it might be called) are integrated, to be sure, but
they are separate entities that evolve independently of each other. The
key to understanding it, though, is the fact that the assemblage itself
is virtual, even though its contents may be actual.
The structure of the assemblage, which they elaborate in *Mille Plateaux* (1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987), is drawn
from the work of the Danish linguist [[Hjelmslev, Louis]], but it also
combines elements of Stoic language philosophy (which Deleuze writes
about in his book *Logique du sens* (1969), translated as *The Logic of
Sense* (1990)) and somewhat residually elements of [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s concept of the
[[objet (petit) a]]. The
latter points to the fact that the assemblage began life as the concept
of the [[desiring-machine]],
but evolved considerably between the writing of *L'Anti-Œdipe* (1972),
translated as *Anti-Oedipus* (1977), and its sequel *Mille Plateaux*
(1980). This connection is important because, in their analysis of
[[desire]], Deleuze and
Guattari argue that it can only manifest by means of the assemblage. And
in interviews given after the publication of *A Thousand Plateaus*
Deleuze said they created the concept as an intervention into the
discourse on
[[behaviourism]].
Although widely used and generally accepted as the standard translation
of Deleuze and Guattari's original word '*agencement*', assemblage is
nonetheless a contested choice because the meanings of the French and
English words do not line up exactly. The added problem is that
assemblage in English is a loan word from French. It has been suggested
that 'arrangement' would be a better translation. Given how
well-established assemblage is now, it is probably a moot point to
question the translation, but it is important to remember that it *is* a
translation because the secondary literature on what is now known as
'assemblage theory' (following the work of Manuel DeLanda) tends to
derive its applications of the term from its meaning in English. Thus,
there is an emphasis on assembling in Anglophone uses of the concept
which is inconsistent with its original meaning in French.
The concept of the assemblage has also been taken up by
[[actor network theory]]
([[ANT]]) and [[new materialism]]. In each case
its meaning deviates from Deleuze and Guattari's original conception. In
the case of ANT, as John Law explains in *After Method: Mess in Social
Science Research* (2004), there is a strong emphasis placed on the idea
of [[complex]], and the
assemblage is used as a way of thinking about causality in situations
where clear lines of causality are difficult to discern. Law gives the
case of a train crash in which it is unclear whether it was driver error
or a signal fault that caused the disaster. For ANT the concept of the
assemblage is a way of incorporating non-human and other-than-human
agency. New materialism has a similar concern, but as Jane Bennett
illustrates in *Vibrant Matter* (2010), there is a strong emphasis on
the agency of matter itself. The assemblage is defined as a
confederation of energetic matter.
