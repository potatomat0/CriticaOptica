[[abject]]
 That which disturbs
the self by provoking an
[[uncanny]] feeling of
disgust, fear, loathing, or repulsion. The abject is the excessive
dimension of either a subject or an object; it is that which cannot be
assimilated---i.e. we cannot make it part of ourselves. The paradox of
the abject is that it is simultaneously outside or beyond the subject
and a product of the subject. Our own bodily fluids are for the most
part loathsome to us, but the intensity of that loathing owes precisely
to the fact that they come from inside us. Thus, human faeces are more
disgusting to us than dog faeces, despite the fact that there is no real
material difference between them. The abject is not, therefore, an
intrinsic quality of a thing, a being, or a state of affairs; it is
rather a disturbance in a state of affairs characterized by matter being
out of place (e.g. faeces in the toilet do not bother us as much as
faeces on the kitchen floor). The abject tends to be subject to moral,
religious, and cultural laws of taboo and proscription. It is not merely
considered dirty in other words, but also profane and profaning. It
manifests as a peculiar type of response, an inherently ambiguous and
ambivalent [[affect]], the
strange power of which seems to suggest we are drawn to that which
repels us. According to [[Kristeva, Julia]] this is because
it recalls---psychically---the moment of our separation from the womb,
an occasion that is simultaneously bloody, painful, traumatizing,
liberating, and beautiful. For this reason, too, the abject tends to be
associated more with the feminine than the masculine. For obvious
reasons, the concept of the abject has been particularly important in
cinema studies, where it is used to explain the appeal of gory horror
films and slimy SF films. *See also*
