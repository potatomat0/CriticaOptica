[[active]]

 and reactive German
philosopher [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]] (and after him
French philosopher [[Deleuze, Gilles]]) used these
categories to describe two different ways of acting and---by
extension---being in the world. An action (which may be a thought,
feeling, or practice) is active when it takes something as its object;
conversely, it becomes reactive when it is made the object of someone or
something else. Thus, if we feel sad (or happy) and we do not know why
we feel this way, then we are reactive; if, however, we can discover the
reason we are feeling this way, we can convert reactive forces into
active forces. Reactive is not the same as negative and should not be
thought of as intrinsically bad; it is, rather, the usual state of
things. It is, however, a limiting state of things, because it separates
us from what we can do---if we are sad for no apparent reason, and we do
not seek out the cause, then we are prevented from forming an
appropriate response to that cause, and our power to act is reduced. We
are reacting when we could be acting, and more problematically still we
are using our reaction to excuse our lack of action. Nietzsche generally
refers to this state as
[[ressentiment]].
Therefore, the challenge for both philosophy and life, according to
Nietzsche, is to overcome the reactive state of things and become
active, thereby constantly enhancing our power to act.
