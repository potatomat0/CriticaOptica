[[aphanisis]]

 Ernest Jones,
[[Freud, Sigmund]]'s
biographer, adopted this word, which in Greek means 'disappearance', to
describe the loss of sexual desire. In Jones's view, Freud's theory of
castration does not go far enough---it is not the fear of castration
that motivates the resolution of the [[Oedipus complex]] he argues, but the
far greater fear of the loss of desire itself. By this means he sought
to find a common denominator in the sexual development of boys and girls
that did not centre on the presence or absence of the penis. [[Lacan, Jacques]] also uses this term,
though not in exactly the same way. For Lacan it means the loss of
subjectivity. The
[[projection]], Lacan argues,
is not afraid of losing desire; on the contrary, losing desire is
precisely what they want to achieve. Aphanisis is in this latter regard
a mechanism of defence.
