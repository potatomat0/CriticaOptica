[[allegory]]

 A form of artwork
(whether architectural, textual, visual, plastic, or musical) whose
outward appearance is contrived to suggest a hidden or second order of
meaning that is in some sense the 'true' meaning. This is often achieved
by means of symbols, but there are many other techniques as well, such
as personification and *trompe l'Å“il*. Readers of C. S. Lewis's Narnia
books or J. R. R. Tolkien's Ring Trilogy are bombarded by images that
point to a deeper significance, or meaning beyond the surface of the
text. In the case of Narnia, self-sacrificing characters like the great
lion Aslan cannot but be figures of Christ, while it is difficult not to
think of the Hobbits as personifications of that mythic place known as
'Middle England'. For the most part, allegories are creative rewritings
or reimaginings of a pre-existing text such as the Bible, but as
[[Jameson, Fredric]] shows in
*The Political Unconscious* (1981), history itself can be used as a
prior text for the purpose of constructing allegory (in his later work
he develops a notion of [[national allegory]] to describe
artworks that use the nation itself as their prior text). Allegory is
important to the work of [[Frye, Northrop]], [[de Man, Paul]], and [[Benjamin, Walter]], all of whom
devise multilayered models of allegory. Allegory should be distinguished
from [[metaphor]].
