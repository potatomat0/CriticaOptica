[[Artaud, Antonin]]
(1896--1948) French poet and playwright. His notion of a [[Theatre of Cruelty]] had an enormous
influence on twentieth-century experimental theatre. Owing to illness,
both mental and physical, Artaud spent a considerable portion of his
childhood in hospital. This set a trend that was to continue for the
rest of his life. He was conscripted into the army in 1916, but was soon
discharged on medical grounds. It was during one of his rest cures, as
they were known, in a sanatorium that he was prescribed laudanum as a
mental relaxant, with the result that he became an addict of opiates.
Artaud never had a proper career. He lurched from one thing to another,
seemingly at random, but apparently with the constant aim of challenging
the perception of reality. At the age of 27, Artaud sent poems to the
journal *La Nouvelle Revue Française*, which were rejected by its editor
Jacques Rivière, who was nonetheless intrigued enough by what he read to
start a correspondence with Artaud. These letters in turn became
Artaud's first major book. He was also able to pick up work as an actor
in a few silent films, gaining minor roles in films directed by Germaine
Dulac and Carl Dreyer.
Artaud was involved with the
[[Surrealism]] movement at
this time too, but he was expelled by the so-called Pope of Surrealism [[Breton, André]] 
though not
before he formed an association with Roger Vitrac, who was also expelled
from the movement. Together they ran the [[Jarry, Alfred]] Theatre, named after
the creator of
[[’pataphysics]], from 1926
to 1928. They directed works by Vitrac, Claudel, and Strindberg, to
great critical success. Despite the fact that productions were attended
by the leading intellectuals of the period, including André Gide and
Paul Valéry, the venture failed commercially and was forced to fold.
In 1931 Artaud witnessed a performance of Balinese dance at the Colonial
Exposition in Paris and though he didn't understand it fully, it proved
utterly transformative of his thinking about what theatre can and should
be. Its influence can clearly be seen in the 'First Manifesto for a
Theatre of Cruelty', which was published in *La Nouvelle Revue
Française* in the same year. A few years later, in 1935, Artaud
travelled to Mexico where he had a second transformative experience in
an encounter with the Tarahumaran people (his experiments with peyote
were no doubt a factor too). He returned to France in 1937. His most
important work *The Theatre and its Double*, bearing the traces of both
these encounters, was published in 1938. It proved to be one of the most
influential theatrical manifestos of the twentieth century.
The last ten years of Artaud's life were spent in mental asylums. He
continued to write prolifically, however, and produced some of his most
challenging works in these years. It is highly likely that Artaud was a
schizophrenic and it is as an authentic voice of 'madness' that his
work, outside of the theatre, is celebrated and examined, particularly
by [[Foucault, Michel]] and
[[Deleuze, Gilles]].
