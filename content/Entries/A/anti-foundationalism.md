[[anti-foundationalism]]

 A
philosophical position which rejects
[[foundationalism]], i.e. it
rejects the need to ground philosophy. Anti-foundationalist philosophers
are often accused of being
[[nihilism]] or moral
[[relativism]] because their
position cannot claim any absolute ground on which to base itself. This
is exacerbated, too, by its refusal of
[[metaphysics]] categories
such as truth, which might be used in place of absolute grounds.
However, while it is true that anti-foundationalism is susceptible to
these charges, that does not mean the position is an empty one. Noted
anti-foundationalist philosophers include [[Rorty, Richard]] and [[Fish, Stanley]].
