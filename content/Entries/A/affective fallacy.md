[[affective fallacy]]

 A core
idea of [[New Criticism]]. In
a famous paper, entitled 'The Affective Fallacy' (1954), W. K. Wimsatt
and Monroe Beardsley, argue that the way a work affects its
reader---whether it makes us laugh, cry, bored, etc.---is not a valid
source of critical judgement about a text's relative worth as
literature. Rather one must concentrate on its formal properties because
these and these alone are sufficient to distinguish good literature from
bad. *See also* [intentional
fallacy](#X399c4d97e01480b35cf0b0ccc3050de0911cacc).
