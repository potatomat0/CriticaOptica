[[alterity]]

 The otherness of
the other. Alterity refers to both the quality of strangeness inherent
in the other and the fact of their strangeness. Strangeness here means
simply that neither our prior knowledge nor our prior experience
prepares us for the encounter with *this* other. For [[Levinas, Emmanuel]], the Paris-based
Lithuanian philosopher and ethicist who established the concept, the
only being capable of fully satisfying these conditions is God. His
notion of ethics revolves around the idea that one should open oneself
to an encounter with the divine Mystery, that is, the alterity, of God
as other. This notion has also been used in anthropology, particularly
by Michael Taussig in *Mimesis and Alterity* (1993), as a way of
thinking about the relationship between the colonizers and the
colonized. It has also been used in
[[psychoanalysis]] to
describe the relationship between the self and the other, namely that
part of ourselves (such as the
[[abject]]) that we disavow.
