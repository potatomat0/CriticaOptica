[[anxiety]] **(*angst*)

** In
[[psychoanalysis]], the
mental and physical manifestation---or symptom---of either (i) a
heightened amount of stimulation (specifically, sexual stimulation) or
(ii) the absence or insufficiency of the processes of 'working through'
or expelling excess excitation. Anxiety is ideational inasmuch as it is
always bound to an idea (i.e. a particular image or thought), but it is
usually possible to decipher or decode this idea as a sign or substitute
for another repressed idea. Anxiety differs from
[[hysteria]], which presents
in a very similar manner, in that nervous tension is deflected onto a
physical object, rather than the psyche. The two pathways are by no
means mutually exclusive and they are often seen occurring together. In
[[existentialism]],
particularly in the work of the Danish theologian SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard,
anxiety is an unfocused or objectless fear, such as the fear provoked by
freedom---being free to do what one pleases creates the anxiety of not
knowing what one wants to do or indeed should do. This theme, the
anxiety caused by freedom, is further developed in the work of [[Heidegger, Martin]] and [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]].
