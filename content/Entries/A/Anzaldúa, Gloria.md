[[Anzaldúa, Gloria]]
(1942--2004) Mexican-American, radical lesbian cultural critic and
writer. Born in the Rio Grande Valley in Southern Texas, she received
her BA from the Pan American University and her MA from the University
of Texas at Austin. Anzaldúa was an early critic of what she saw as the
colour and class blindness of feminist theory and through collective
works like *This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of
Colour* (1981), co-edited with Cherríe Moraga, sought to raise awareness
of the implications of this blindness. Her most famous work,
*Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza* (1987), is a poetic attack on
the binaries that shape everyday life---black/white, male/female, and so
on---and a powerful celebration of diversity. Anzaldúa advocated a
vision of life she referred to as 'mestiza', which means 'mixed', but
should also be understood as a refusal of binary logic, extending it to
every sphere of existence from biology to ideology.
