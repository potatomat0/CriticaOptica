[[Austin, John Langshaw]]
(1911--60) British philosopher of language, best known as the originator
of [[speech act]] theory and
the concept of the
[[performative]]. Born in
Lancaster, but raised in St Andrews in Scotland, Austin was educated at
Balliol College, Oxford. During World War II he served with MI6. After
the war he was appointed to a professorship at Oxford. Austin was very
far from prolific; he published only seven papers in his lifetime. His
most influential work, *How to Do Things with Words: The William James
Lectures delivered at Harvard University in 1955* (1962), was published
posthumously. Austin's decisive and lasting contribution to language
philosophy was to challenge the accepted view of his own time that the
principle function of sentences is to state facts (real or imagined).
Austin argued persuasively that there are whole classes of sentences
which either do more than simply state facts, or do not state facts at
all, but rather perform actions. These types of sentences, such as
declarations like 'I name this ship *Enterprise*', he called
performative utterances because the very act of saying them can in
certain conditions perform an action. Similarly, by saying 'it is cold'
we may induce someone to close a window or switch on a heater, so again
the utterance has a performative dimension. Austin died before he could
develop his ideas into a full-blown theory (which he seemed to lack the
taste for in any case), so it has been left to others, particularly
[[Searle, John Rogers]] and (in very
different, much more speculative ways) [[Butler, Judith]] and [[Deleuze, Gilles]], to explore all
its implications. Austin's work is not without its critics, the two most
prominent being [[Gellner, Ernest]] and [[Derrida, Jacques]]. The latter wrote
a short critique of Austin's theory in *Marges de la philosophie*
(1962), translated as *Margins of Philosophy* (1982), which prompted a
reply from Searle, and thereby sparked one of the most spectacular
ripostes in philosophical history from Derrida.
[[auteur theory]] (author
theory) A theory of film which not only ascribes the director with an
authorial-like control over the final look of the film, but also
dismisses as worthless those films in which no such unity of vision is
discernible. Following this model, any film by Alfred Hitchcock, even
the half-baked late ones like *Torn Curtain* (1966) and *Topaz* (1969),
will always be more highly regarded than any film by Michael Bay,
including his blockbusters like *Bad Boys* (1995) and *Armageddon*
(1998), even though Bay's thrillers are more thrilling than Hitchcock's
to the majority of today's viewers. *Auteur* theory is generally
associated with the French film journal *Cahiers du cinéma*, which was
launched in 1951, particularly the 1954 article 'Une Certaine tendance
du cinéma' by critic and director François Truffaut which became a kind
of manifesto for the [[French New Wave]] or [[Nouvelle Vague]]. The actual phrase
'*auteur* theory' originates with American film critic Andrew Sarris,
who transformed the debate in the pages of *Cahiers du cinéma* referred
to as the *politique des auteurs* into a distinctive methodological
programme. This debate began when, impressed by the Hollywood films
imported into France following the end of the Second World War after
several years absence, the *Cahiers du cinéma* authors re-evaluated
their view of American film, which they had previously dismissed as
commercial schlock. They noted that while American directors like Howard
Hawks and John Ford (two favourites) had little control over the
production of their films because of the way the studio and star systems
worked, they nonetheless managed to exercise considerable control over
the style of the movie. The authors of *Cahiers du cinéma* conceived of
a new way of thinking about authorship, focusing on the finished style
of a film rather than its actual process of production. In this respect,
*auteur* theory is paradoxical at its core because while it acknowledges
that films are not created by individuals, but in fact require a
veritable army of creative people---ranging from cost accountants to
script writers and camera operators---to realize them, it nevertheless
upholds the idea that the final look of a film can be attributed to a
single individual. In the end, this position proved untenable and film
theory has since taken a much more 'multiple' approach to film.
