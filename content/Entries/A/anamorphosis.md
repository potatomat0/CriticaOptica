[[anamorphosis]]

 A device used
in art, particularly in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, whereby an image is constructed in such a way that it can
only be seen by viewing the painting from a specific angle. Today one
most often sees it in sport---corporate logos are painted onto the pitch
at slightly distorted angles so as to improve their visibility on TV.
French [[psychoanalysis]]
[[Lacan, Jacques]] uses the
example of Holbein's *The Ambassadors* (1533), which contains an image
of a skull concealed in its foreground, to explain
[[desire]]'s inability to
perceive what it wants. The
[[object]] of desire, or more
particularly the object of the drive, cannot be perceived head-on.
[[Žižek, Slavoj]] makes
extensive use of this concept in his account of
[[ideology]] in order to
explain how it is possible for ideological statements to appear
non-ideological.
