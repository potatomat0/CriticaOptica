[[affect]]

 That which the body
and mind suffers (in the classical philosophical sense), which means
simply that it is something we experience passively rather than
[[active]]. One may be
affected both by internal stimulus, from the imagination, the
[[instinct]], or more
generally the [[unconscious]]
([[psychoanalysis]] as a
whole is premised on this idea), or external stimulus, which may take a
huge variety of forms, from simple physical or sensorial stimuli to
complex and cognitive stimuli. Affect is sometimes treated as a synonym
for emotion, but as Brian Massumi argues in *Parables for the Virtual*
(2002) it differs from emotion in that it is beyond our voluntary
control. For example, we may be able to discipline ourselves to ignore
pain in the course of physical training, but we will still feel that
pain. Pain, then, belongs to the order of affect and it is autonomous
from the circuit of emotion, which is effectively our psychological
response to it. In [[Cultural Studies]], in part because of
work by Massumi, and also Lauren Berlant, Lawrence Grossberg, Meaghan
Morris, and Elspeth Probyn, affect has become a key term for rethinking
[[ideology]]. It is generally
used to explain why ideology has the hold it does. To some degree this
interest in affect is sparked by an interest in the work of [[Deleuze, Gilles]], but it also marks
a strong turn toward cognitive psychology. In philosophy, affect is
central to the work of Baruch de Spinoza and [[Bergson, Henri]], authors from whom
Deleuze drew a great deal of inspiration.
