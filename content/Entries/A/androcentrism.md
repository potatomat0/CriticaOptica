[[androcentrism]]
Nineteenth-century American Charlotte Perkins Gilman used this term in
*The Man-Made World or Our Androcentric Culture* (1911) to characterize
what she saw as western thought's orientation around a male point of
view, with the result that what was treated as common sense or universal
was in fact a reflection of male identity and values. In this system of
thought, the feminine perspective is treated as aberrant, a deviation
from the male-centred norm. Feminist linguists like Dale Spender have
shown how this male-centred outlook is ingrained in language,
particularly in the use of the masculine pronoun as the universal term.
