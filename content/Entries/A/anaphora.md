[[anaphora]]

 A means of linking
two sentences, paragraphs, or indeed thoughts, by means of a repetition
of a part of the previous utterance. In the example, 'John came into the
room. He picked up his coat.' the pronoun 'he' functions anaphorically
to inform us who picked up the coat. This point can perhaps be seen more
clearly when compared to the passive formulation of the same example:
'John came into the room. The coat was picked up.' There isn't anything
in the second sentence to connect it to the first, so we have no idea
whether or not there is any relationship between John entering the room
and the coat being picked up. *See also*
[[cataphora]].
