[[authenticity]]

 The term used
in [[existentialism]]
philosophy to describe what it considers the ideal mode of living. It is
characterized by high levels of self-awareness, self-direction, and
self-reflection. That is to say, someone whose life may be considered
authentic is always fully aware of both what they are doing and why they
are doing it. Attaining this level of self-knowledge effectively means
overcoming the power of the
[[unconscious]] to compel us
to act without fully knowing why, therefore most theorists of
authenticity treat it as project, something one aspires to or works
towards. In philosophy, [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] and [[Heidegger, Martin]] wrote
extensively on the problematic authenticity, while [[Adorno, Theodor]] attacked it as
obfuscating. Outside of philosophy, authenticity has been a topic of
interest for both literary studies and [[Cultural Studies]]---in the case of the
former it generally refers to life in the pre-industrial era (e.g. [F.
R.  *Leavis](#Xb5c1a70d9f1ada97cdc403a4636ae519d49c775), [[Williams, Raymond]]), while in the
latter it is used as a synonym for artistic or cultural production that
is 'independent' or anti-commercial (e.g. 'grunge' music and Dogme
cinema have at different times been claimed as authentic).
