[[aporia]]

 In classical
philosophy, it is a point of perplexity, where a combination of axioms
and/or propositions (each true in their own right) are found to be
incompatible. Contemporary ethics is constantly faced by such
situations: consider the conundrum posed by the notions of the 'right to
life' and the 'freedom to choose' in the case of abortions. Taken on
their own, most people would support the notion that everyone has a
right to life and a right to the freedom to choose how they live that
life. In the case of abortion, the proper allocation of these rights is
difficult to determine with any precision. Faced with such vexed issues
as this, many commentators find themselves resorting to the second
meaning of aporia, which in
[[rhetoric]] refers to
figures of speech in which the speaker expresses self-doubt, e.g. 'I
really don't know how to decide between these two rights, but I will
nonetheless endeavour to do so'. In the work of [[Derrida, Jacques]] aporia is a
central concern: it is a basic point of the
[[deconstruction]] method
that any text, indeed any statement, can be shown to consist of a
multiplicity of aporias.
