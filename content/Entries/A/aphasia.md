[[aphasia]]

 A language disorder
that manifests itself as either an inability to speak or an inability to
comprehend speech, or both. The disorder can vary in degrees of severity
up to and including complete loss of language. It may affect written
language comprehension as well. [[Freud, Sigmund]] and more especially
[[Jakobson, Roman]] were
interested in aphasia, both seeing it as a key to understanding language
more generally.
