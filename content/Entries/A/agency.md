[[agency]]

 In sociology and
philosophy, the degree to which a
[[subject]] is able to
determine the course of their own actions. The concept is generally used
in the context of discussions about the factors that shape [[everyday life]] and place a limit on
agency. For instance, relative levels of wealth clearly impact on the
degree of agency someone might have. As [[Marx, Karl]] famously put it,
people make history, but not in conditions of their own choosing.
