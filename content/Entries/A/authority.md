[[authority]]

 In political
theory and sociology it refers to the legitimacy (or not) of the use of
power. If a particular power is perceived as legitimate and it has
authority, then we accede to its demands without the need of coercion or
threat. The analysis of authority was developed by the German
sociologist [[Weber, Max]],
who was principally interested in the issue of how authority is
obtained. Weber identified three kinds of authority: (i)
rational-legal---government depends for its authority on the fact that
laws have the appearance of necessity (e.g., it is rational to ban
murder and so on); (ii) traditional authority---authority derives from
long established customs, laws and practices, the sense that things have
always been thus and should remain thus; (iii) charismatic
authority---the authority an individual claims or derives from a higher
power, such as destiny or God. [[Certeau, Michel de]], in his analysis
of [[May ’68]], argued that
what the street protests indicated was that the government of the day
had lost its authority, even though it had retained power. Similarly,
[[Žižek, Slavoj]] has argued
that the loss of authority is a precursor to the loss of power, as is
evidenced by the so-called 'colour' revolutions.
