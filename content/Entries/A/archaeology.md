[[archaeology]]

 French
historian [[Foucault, Michel]]
uses this term to describe his research methodology. It is characterized
by the suspension of all established conventions for thinking and doing
history and the supposition that those very conventions for thinking and
doing history should themselves be subjected to historical inquiry.
Outlined in extensive detail in *L'Arch√©ologie du savoir* (1969),
translated as *The Archaeology of Knowledge* (1972), archaeology takes
shape as a series of injunctions against the perceived unities of
author, discipline, genre, and a corresponding call to recognize the
significance of dispersion, recurrence, and transformation. Foucault
wanted to shift the objective of history away from what has been said
and done to the set of conditions (which he referred to as the
[[discursive formation]])
enabling those things to be said and done. For example, for Foucault
what is important is not the fact that the mentally ill are locked up,
but the diverse ways by which the very classification 'mentally ill'
came into being in such a way as to render 'normal' the incarceration of
those people so classified.
