[[Appadurai, Arjun]]
 (1949--)


Indian-born, US-based cultural anthropologist and co-founder of the
important [[collocation]]
theory journal *Public Culture*. Born and educated in Mumbai, Appadurai
moved to the US in 1967, completing a BA at Brandeis, followed by a PhD
at the University of Chicago. He now works at The New School, New York.
In 1988 he edited a collection of essays entitled *The Social Life of
Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective*, which set out to chart (on
a global scale) the creation and regulation of and variation in taste,
asking why one kind of thing is valued in one place and not another and
just as importantly at one time and not another. His introductory essay
to this collection is a landmark in the field of cultural anthropology.
Perhaps his most important work, at least from the perspective of
critical theory, is *Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of
Globalization* (1996), which offers a fivefold theory of global cultural
flows, or [[-scapes]], that
taken together comprise the contemporary social
[[imaginary]]. His most
recent work, *Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger*
(2006), has concentrated on
[[affect]], particularly
anger.
