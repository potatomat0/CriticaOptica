[[actual]]

 and virtual A modal
distinction proposed by French philosopher [[Deleuze, Gilles]] as a replacement
for the problematic real-possible distinction more commonly used in
philosophy. The possible is a bad concept according to Deleuze because
it presupposes that everything that is real must also be possible (which
rules out a great number of conceptual inventions, consigning them to
the ontologically lesser category of the unreal, or impossible), and it
is unable to explain why that which is possible has not already come
into being. For Deleuze, both the actual and the virtual are fully
real---the former has concrete existence, while the latter does not, but
it is no less real for that fact. The importance of this distinction can
readily be seen by giving thought to the state of being of an idea: it
may only exist in our heads, or on paper, but its effects are fully real
and may also be fully actual too. Initially treated as an esoteric
distinction of interest only to specialists in the field of
[[ontology]], since the
advent of computer games, and more especially the Internet, this
distinction has become very important because it allows that what is
seen or experienced on screen is still real, even if it isn't actual.
