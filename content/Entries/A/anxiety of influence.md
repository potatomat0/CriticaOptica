[[anxiety of influence]]
[[Bloom, Harold]]'s theory of
poetic influence and succession. First outlined in detail in *The Anxiety of Influence* (1973), but central to all his subsequent work,
Bloom's thesis is that all poets must confront their precursors in a
quasi-[[field]] struggle in
order to create an imaginative space for themselves. The strong poets
are able to digest, or sublimate their precursors via a process Bloom
refers to as creative misreading. That is, these strong poets find their
own truth in the work of their precursors and use that as their source
of inspiration. In contrast, weak poets are only able to idealize and
imitate their precursors. Bloom extended this idea to all forms of
creative writing in *The Western Canon: The Books and the School of the
Ages* (1994).
