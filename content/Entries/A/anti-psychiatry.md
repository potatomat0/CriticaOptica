[[anti-psychiatry]]

 A highly
politicized group of psychiatrists and psychotherapists active in London
in the 1960s and 1970s who rejected traditional definitions of madness
as well as the (then) standard treatments for mental illness (e.g.
electro-convulsive therapy, lobotomy, anti-psychotic drugs). It viewed
madness as a social construct, or more strongly as an effect of the
pressures society places on certain people. It saw psychosis as a
shamanistic journey by means of which people tried to express the
oppressive effects of socialization. The term itself was coined by
[[Cooper, David]], a South
African psychiatrist who collaborated with [[Laing, Ronald David]] and others in the
establishment of Kingsley Hall, an experiment in community-psychiatry
started in 1965 in East London. *Mary Barnes: Two Accounts of a Journey
through Madness* (1971), written by one of the patients at Kingsley Hall
in collaboration with her psychiatrist Joseph Berke, offers a keen but
not altogether flattering insight into what anti-psychiatry meant in
practice. In fact, the book did the movement a lot of damage by exposing
what many of its critics saw as its unethical practices. French
philosopher, [[Foucault, Michel]] is often
associated with the anti-psychiatry movement, but although his first
book *Folie et Déraison: Histoire de la Folie à l'âge classique* (1961),
translated in abridged form as *Madness and Civilization* (1965) and in
complete form as *History of Madness* (2006), was a powerful influence
on Laing and Cooper in particular, he did not consider himself a part of
the movement. Similarly, anti-psychoanalyst [[Guattari, Félix]] was influenced by
some of the tenets of anti-psychiatry, but ultimately he rejected the
movement as a failed experiment because in his eyes it did nothing to
alleviate the suffering of schizophrenics.
