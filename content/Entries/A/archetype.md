[[archetype]]

 The inherited
dimension of the [[psyche]]
according to the analytical psychology of [[Jung, Carl]]. Archetypes are ways
of thinking and acting that derive from the most primitive aspects of
our psyche, which for Jung means that dimension of the psyche we have in
common with our most distant ancestors. There is a large variety of
archetypes, each one pointing to a different mode of action such as
caring for another or defending oneself from attack. Taken together they
form a dynamic preconscious system which is actively seeking
actualization in the form of an association,
[[complex]], idea, or at the
negative extreme a symptom. The most well-known example is the binary
pair animus/anima---the former is the archetypal image woman has of man
and the latter the archetypal image man has of woman. Archetypes can
usefully be compared with the structure referred to in
[[ethology]] as innate
releasing mechanisms. They are powerful forces compelling action, which
is why the conscious has to engage them and bring them under control.
