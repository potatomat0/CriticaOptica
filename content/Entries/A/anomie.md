[[anomie]]

 The absence of
social norms, regulations or laws. Not to be confused with
[[anarchism]], anomie is an
[[existentialism]] condition
rather than a specific state of affairs. Anomie can arise even within a
very well regulated society if those norms, regulations or laws lose
their legitimacy and aren't replaced by an alternative vision of how
things should be. Derived from the Greek word 'nomos', meaning law, the
term was first used by French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau, but its most
well-known formulation is that of French sociologist [[Durkheim, Ã‰mile]], who used it in
his book *Suicide* (1897) to describe a situation in which social
changes---particularly those relating to employment prospects---bring
about a situation in which people begin to feel hopeless and without a
future because of the discrepancy between public discourse (what the
government proclaims to be true) and the evidence on the ground, which
belies that rhetoric.
