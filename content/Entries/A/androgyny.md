[[androgyny]]

 A neologism
constructed from the Greek words for male (andro-) and female (-gyny) to
describe a state of unity or ambiguity with respect to gender assignment
arising from the presence in one body of sex characteristics from both
genders. The androgyne has a central position in Swiss psychoanalyst
Carl Jung's theory because in his view the androgyne represents the
resolution of the anxieties and tensions of sexual difference in favour
of complementarity. His theorization of the place of the androgyne in
culture reflects the widespread presence of such figures in myth. And
although Christianity is surprisingly free of such figures, Jung
detected in Christ an androgyne quality he saw as essential. For similar
reasons, though arrived at quite independently, English writer Virginia
Woolf gives prominence to the androgyne as well. She famously argued in
*A Room of One's Own* (1929) that an androgynous consciousness was an
essential precondition to becoming an artist. Her viewpoint is not,
however, widely shared in feminist theory.
