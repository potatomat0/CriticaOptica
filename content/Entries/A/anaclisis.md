[[anaclisis]]

 Derived from the
Greek word meaning to rest upon or lean on, it is used in
[[psychoanalysis]] to
designate the relationship between the sexual instincts and the
self-preservation instincts (or life-drive). [[Freud, Sigmund]] uses anaclisis in
two main ways: first, to explain the genesis of sexuality; and, second,
to explain [[object]] choice.
According to Freud, sexual instincts lean on the life instincts because
the body provides the erotic zones and specific pleasures or affects
that it detaches and develops into sexual pleasures. For example, the
breast-feeding baby obtains pleasure from suckling that is over and
above---'bonus pleasure' Freud calls it---the simple satisfaction of
hunger. This affect and its object, the breast, become in turn the
foundations of sexual pleasure. Similarly, the choice moves beyond
auto-eroticism by attaching itself to an
[[object]] initially favoured
by the [[ego]].
