[[apperception]]

 A term
invented by Leibniz to describe the mind's apprehension of its own inner
state. [[Kant, Immanuel]]
distinguishes between two types of apperception: empirical and
transcendental. The former is the changing consciousness of the
[[everyday life]] self, while the
latter is the unchangeable consciousness that provides the unity of
experience necessary to the existence of the
[[subject]].
