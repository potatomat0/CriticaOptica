[[avant-garde]]

 A military term
referring to a group of soldiers who attack in advance of the main body
used as a metaphor for any self-consciously advanced or antagonistic
position in politics, literature, philosophy, and religion that
challenges conventions and is, as it were, ahead of its time. It first
came into vogue in the latter part of the nineteenth century in France,
where it was used to describe radical and
[[utopia]] forms of
political thinking. The artistic avant-garde arose alongside the
political avant-garde, but developed its own way of speaking and
thinking about what it meant by the avant-garde. For artists in this
period, such as the poet Arthur Rimbaud, art's goal should be not only
to break with the past, but actively to condemn artistic precursors,
with a view to creating not merely new works of art but an entirely new
artistic language. In this sense the avant-garde is often considered to
be more an attitude than a discernible style. Paradoxically, this meant
the avant-garde had a built-in limitation: the need constantly to break
with tradition and overturn convention meant that it soon came to be
seen as mannered and almost a form of self-parody. Its ability to
produce new artistic languages was soon exhausted, such that critics
often speak of the avant-garde in crisis terms.
It is sometimes used as a synonym for
[[modernism]], but while
there is an element of truth in this, it is misleading too, inasmuch as
avant-garde does not imply either a particular period or style. More
generally, though, avant-garde is used in [[critical theory]] as a code word for
the problem of the new, which in the era of
[[postmodernism]] is
considered especially acute because it is thought all possible forms of
artistic experimentation have been tried. The notion of the avant-garde
is therefore an
[[collocation]] as well as an
artistic or historical problematic in that it contains the question of
its own possibility: what does it take to be absolutely new? For this
reason, books about the avant-garde tend to focus on its theory rather
than its praxis.
