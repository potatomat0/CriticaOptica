[[Agamben, Giorgio]]
 (1942--)


Italian philosopher. Born in Rome, Agamben studied at the University of
Rome, where he completed a doctorate on the political thought of Simone
Weil. He undertook postdoctoral study in Germany, participating in
[[Heidegger, Martin]]'s
seminars on Heraclitus and
[[genre]]. He was close
friends with Pier Paolo Pasolini (who gave him the bit part of the
Apostle Philip in his film *The Gospel According to St Mathew* (1964))
and [[Calvino, Italo]], two of
Italy's most prominent intellectuals of the period. Passionate about
[[Benjamin, Walter]]'s work,
which he researched extensively in the archives at the Bibliothèque
Nationale de France, where he discovered several important manuscripts,
Agamben also edited the translation into Italian of his complete works.
A highly erudite
[[philology]], Agamben
reads contemporary works through the lens of classical philosophy. His
early works, reflecting his Heideggerian training, are focused on the
history of metaphysics in western philosophy. He is particularly
interested in the relation between language and death and the way
western philosophy since Hegel has tended to posit an ineffable
dimension to language as an equivalent to death. He sets out this
argument in the aptly titled *Language and Death* (1991) and extends the
discussion in *Infancy and History* (1993). He argues that infancy,
which literally means being without language, provides an instance of
experience that is unmediated by language and therefore provides the
grounds for thinking that experience precedes language in ontological
terms, not just chronological terms. From metaphysics, Agamben moved
onto aesthetics in *Stanzas* (1993) and *Idea of Prose* (1995), which
argues that the division between poetry and philosophy is essentially
impossible to maintain.
His most well-known work, the cycle of books devoted to the holocaust
(*Homo Sacer* (1998), *Remnants of Auschwitz* (1999), *Means Without
End* (2000), *State of Exception* (2005), *The Signature of All Things*
(2009), and *The Use of Bodies* (2016)), draws on his classical
background to develop a theory of what he calls [[bare life]] (*nuda vita*). Agamben
notes that classical philosophy, unlike contemporary western philosophy,
distinguishes between political life (*bios*), i.e. a form of life
regulated by notions of the good and the proper, and the simple fact of
life itself (*zōē*), i.e. that which animals and humans have in common.
Agamben shows that although this distinction does not exist in most
modern European languages, it nevertheless persists in the operation of
what Foucault called
[[biopolitics]]. As he shows
with respect to the Holocaust, the Nazis first of all removed the Jews
from the realm of *bios* by denying them citizenship and then interning
them in camps where they reduced to the most abject form of *zōē*
imaginable.
The separation of political life from bare life is, Agamben argues, the
genesis of fascism because it enables a politics that puts biological
traits and concerns before the social, regulating bodies not people. As
he shows in *Means Without End*, the treatment of refugees and asylum
seekers around the world---Australia, Europe, and the US in
particular---follows the same logic: the refugees are left to die in the
desert or drown in the sea because their place of birth, their skin
colour, or their religion makes them 'undesirable'. Agamben's later work
follows the thread from this starting point to the paradoxes of
democratic constitutions, which allow that to 'save' democracy,
democracy itself may be suspended by the declaration of martial law.
Agamben describes this as a 'state of exception', and his work traces
the way this paradoxical process of excluding to include features in a
wide variety of social mechanisms.
Agamben has also written a long cycle of books on religious themes in
Judaeo-Christian thought, focusing particularly on messianism
(continuing Benjamin's work): *The Open* (2004), *The Kingdom and the
Glory* (2011), and *The Highest Poverty* (2013).
