[[Althusser, Louis]] 
(1918--90)


French Marxist philosopher and one of the most influential thinkers of
the twentieth century. His work fused the insights of
[[Marxism]],
[[structuralism]], and
[[psychoanalysis]] to create
a powerful critique of contemporary capitalist society, focusing
particularly on the function of
[[ideology]]. His aim was to
revive the revolutionary dimension of Marxism and construct a theory
that could make a real and practical difference in the world.
Althusser's academic career was unconventional. In spite of his renown,
he never held a prestigious chair at a university. He worked as a tutor
at the ENS for his entire career, where his students included such
future luminaries as [[Foucault, Michel]] and [[Derrida, Jacques]], among many
others. Although a prolific and ambitious author (his goal was nothing
less than a complete reinterpretation of
[[Marxism]]), he never produced
a full account of his theory. His publications consist of a series of
fragmentary interventions (several written in collaboration with
students) into a variety of philosophical and political debates as well
as a number of autocritiques or self-criticisms, frequently as damning
as any of those produced by his detractors. He also left behind a
substantial corpus of unpublished work, including a number of
book-length manuscripts, a full assessment of which has yet to be made.
His most important works, *Pour Marx* (1965) translated as *For Marx*
(1969), *Lire le capital* (1968), translated as *Reading Capital*
(1970), and *Lenin and Philosophy* (1971) continue to be read and
studied.
In his highly combative account of Althusser's work *Arguments within
English Marxism* (1980), [[Anderson, Perry]] argues that
Althusser's thought took shape in response to the Sino-Soviet dispute
which erupted in response to Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956. Contrary to [[Thompson, Edward Palmer]], whose *Poverty of Theory* (1978) provided the immediate occasion for Anderson's
remarks, Anderson argues that Althusser was sympathetic to Khrushchev's
anti-Stalinist position, but unsympathetic to his reformist proposals,
which he felt betrayed the revolutionary spirit of Marx. He called
instead for a 'Left critique' of Stalin, which in effect meant trying to
get back to an understanding of Marx's thought before the Stalinist
re-interpretation of it. Althusser used the slogan 'return to Marx' to
rally support for this program at the same time that his friend [[Lacan, Jacques]] was calling for a
'return to Freud'. This put him out of favour with the French Communist
Party, of which he was a staunch member for most of his life, because it
implies a higher authority than the party itself.
In the sympathetic but exacting work, *Althusser: The Detour of Theory*
(1987), for many the definitive account of Althusser and
Althusserianism, Gregory Elliott argues that Althusser's philosophical
position is best defined in terms of what he was against: he was
anti-Hegel,
anti-[[historicism]], and
anti-[[humanism]]. He
rejected the young Marx, who was an avid reader of
[[genre]] and consequently
still a humanist and a historicist, in favour of the mature Marx, who
claimed to have stood Hegel back on his feet. The mature Marx was in
Althusser's view the founder of a science, namely [[historical materialism]], with all the
attendant connotations of objective rigour that term implies. Marx, he
argued, had established a science of the general laws of the development
of [[society]], but for that
very reason his work remained incomplete and it was the task of
contemporary Marxism to continue his project. In political terms,
Althusser's reasoning was that if society could be understood
scientifically (in the same way humans understand the natural world),
then that would enable a program of change to be implemented. History,
for Althusser, is a process without a
[[subject]]. He maintained
that it is the masses who make history (not individuals) and that class
struggle is the motor of history.
Spinoza, from whom he adopted the idea of [[structural causality]], rather than Hegel
was Althusser's surprising choice of philosophical predecessor, because
it allowed him to conceive of society and culture as so many
manifestations of an otherwise invisible omnipotent force. In doing so,
Althusser renovated Marx's famous spatial metaphor, which separated
society into an economic
[[space]] (infrastructure),
determinant in the last instance, and a subordinate but semi-autonomous
politico-legal and ideological
[[superstructure]], by
creating the analytic apparatus to explain how the two levels interact.
Comprised of two interrelated but distinct systems, the
[[Repressive State Apparatus]]
([[RSA]]) and the
[[Ideological State Apparatus]]
([[ISA]]), the superstructure
provides the conditions needed for the infrastructure to operate by
facilitating the reproduction of the social relations inherent to
capitalist production. Control of the RSAs (e.g., police, army, courts,
prisons) is not sufficient by itself to maintain power, the state must
also achieve [[hegemony]]
over and in the ISAs (e.g., churches, schools, family media, trade
unions, cultural forms). Ideology was, in turn, redefined by Althusser
as the imaginary relationship we have to the real conditions of our
existence; this relationship is fostered by a process Althusser referred
to as [[interpellation]].
As a leading spokesperson for the revolutionary spirit of Marx's
thought, Althusser was expected by his students and followers to be at
the forefront of the events of [[May ’68]], but illness prevented
him from participating fully. Many saw this as a betrayal and it is now
part of the Althusser legend that his stock as a theorist went into
decline at this precise moment, but the truth is more complicated than
that. Indeed, in the Anglophone world, Althusser's peak period of
influence came after May 1968 in the 1970s when the authors behind the
seminal British film studies journal *Screen* championed his thought.
Similarly, it was not until the 1970s that Althusser's thought took
effect in literary studies, the path having been blazed by the
pioneering work of [[Macherey, Pierre]] in France and
[[Eagleton, Terry]] in
Britain. It was rather his inadequate responses to two other historical
events, the discrediting of the Cultural Revolution in Communist China
and Alexander Solzhenitsyn's revelation of the existence of gulags in
the USSR, which brought his star down to earth.
For most of his life Althusser lived in the tutor's hall of residence at
the ENS on the Rue d'Ulm. There, in 1980, he strangled to death his
partner of thirty-four years, Hélène Rytman. The exact circumstances are
not known, but Althusser was never charged with murder. He was found to
be of diminished capacity and he was committed to the Sainte-Anne
psychiatric hospital, where he remained for three years. He wrote two
autobiographical works, *L'Avenir dure longtemps* (1992), translated as
*The Future Lasts a Long Time* (1993), and *Les Faits* (1992),
translated as *The Facts* (1993), which sought to explain what happened.
Althusser died of a heart attack in 1990 at the age of 72.
Althusser's legacy is difficult to assess. His work no longer has the
influence it did at its peak---there are very few, if any scholars
remaining who would consider themselves to be Althusserian. In part,
this is no doubt a reaction to the tragic events in Althusser's own
life, but it is also attributable to a general decline in the influence
of Marxist thought. Yet, having said that, many of Althusser's former
students and collaborators (e.g. [[Badiou, Alain]], [[Balibar, Étienne]], [[Debray, Régis]], [[Macherey, Pierre]], [[Pêcheux, Michel]], [[Poulantzas, Nicos]], and even
[[Rancière, Jacques]], who
effectively renounced his connection to Althusser in the rather stern
critique *La Leçon d'Althusser* (1974) (The Lesson of Althusser) have
gone on to become significant theorists in their own right, and in their
own way they continue his project of developing Marxism as a
problematic. And in that sense one can say he achieved his goal of
renewing Marxism by invigorating debate within Marxism.
