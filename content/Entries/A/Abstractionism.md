[[Abstractionism]]
 In art, a
movement away from
[[representation]] and
[[mimesis]] towards a kind of
imagery that aims to provoke a response for what it is rather than what
it looks like. For this reason, it is also known as non-figurative art.
Abstractionism can take a variety of forms---in the twentieth century,
the major forms of Abstractionism (to a greater or lesser degree) were:
[[avant-garde]],
[[Dada]],
[[Expressionism]],
[[Futurism]] and
[[Surrealism]]. Artistic
movements such as [[socialist realism]] rejected
Abstractionism as unworthy of the goal of celebrating the achievements
of socialism. Outside the visual arts there were attempts at
Abstractionism in writing (e.g. Gertrude Stein) and music (e.g. Anton
Webern).
