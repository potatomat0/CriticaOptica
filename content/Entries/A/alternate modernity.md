[[alternate modernity]]

 The
theory in development studies and
[[cosmopolitanism]] that
different parts of the world experienced
[[modernity]] in their own
fashion and at their own time. This theory is especially prominent in
China and Brazil, where it is argued that modernity means something
quite specific and different from modernity as experienced elsewhere.
[[Jameson, Fredric]] argues
very strongly against this viewpoint in *A Singular Modernity* (2002),
suggesting that modernity is in reality a codeword for the advent of
capitalism and that this was a global phenomenon.
