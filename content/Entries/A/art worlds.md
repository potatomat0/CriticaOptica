[[art worlds]]

 Sociologist
Howard S. Becker's concept for the milieu that artists create and
require in order to produce art. Like that of [[Bourdieu, Pierre]], Becker's
ultimate goal is to show that art is not the product of the isolated
genius, but is rather the product of a cooperative community. An art
world consists of the institutions and people necessary to the
production and consumption of artistic works. Becker uses this notion to
challenge the notion that the artist as 'genius creator' is solely
responsible for the production of his or her work. As Becker notes, even
the isolated poet still needs someone to produce the pens, paper, and so
on they need to make their art. The artist relies on a network of people
working in a cooperative manner to bring their works into being. The
scale of the network varies considerably according to the type of art,
with poetry at the low end of the scale and cinema at the high end
requiring many hundreds of people to realize it. Art worlds also create
and maintain their own conventions of practice, which facilitates the
production of art---e.g. consider how difficult it would be to make and
share music without the convention of written musical notation.
