[[Moscow Linguistic Circle]]
Discussion group founded by [[Jakobson, Roman]] for the purpose
of investigating the poetic function of language which, together with
the St Petersburg-based
[[Opoyaz]], formed the core
of [[Russian Formalism]]. Its
membership included such key figures as [[Shklovsky, Viktor]] and Yuri
Tynyanov, who would both also play a major part in advancing the
theoretical development of Russian Formalism. The group sought to
connect poetics and linguistics to show you could not properly
understand one in the absence of the other.
