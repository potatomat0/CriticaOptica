[[Millett, Kate]] 
(1934--2017)


American feminist scholar and activist best known for her book *Sexual Politics* (1970). Originally her PhD in English Literature at Columbia
University, *Sexual Politics* offered a powerful critique of sexual
inequality in western art and literature. She demonstrated the deeply
embedded [[patriarchy]]
values in the works of writers like D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and
Norman Mailer (who retaliated with the waspish piece pointedly titled
*The Prisoner of Sex* (1971), denouncing [[political correctness]] in writing). By
contrast, she argued, writers like Jean Genet offer a more nuanced
account of the politics of sexuality. The book was an instant cause
célèbre. Millett was featured on the cover of *Time* magazine and touted
as the new face of
[[feminism]]. *Sexual Politics* was a vanguard text in [[Second Wave feminism]] and its themes
remain as important and resonant today as they were in 1970. Millett was
never comfortable with the role of feminist spokesperson and wrote an
autobiographical account of her experiences following the publication of
*Sexual Politics* in *Flying* (2000). It also deals with the criticism
she received from certain sections of the women's movement for being
bisexual rather than exclusively lesbian. Millett's later work focused
on mental health, particularly the treatment of mental health patients
in hospitals---see *The Loony Bin Trip* (1991), which is
autobiographical account of her forced hospitalization---and prisons,
particularly the cruel treatment of prisoners---see *The Politics of
Cruelty* (1995).
