[[metahistory]]

 The
consideration of what history is in a philosophical sense. The Canadian
literary critic [[Frye, Northrop]] was the first person
to use this term, but it is American historian [[White, Hayden]] who has given the
term its most complete meaning. For Frye it meant simply the speculative
philosophy of history, while for White it is the examination both of
what history is and how that has changed over time. White is
particularly interested in the problematic posed by the fact that
history is a form of narrative, a feature it shares with fiction, and as
he shows in *Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in
Nineteenth-Century Europe* (1973), this has a significant influence on
the range of meanings that can be given to a set of basic facts. Was the
French Revolution inevitable? If so, why didn't similar revolutions
occur elsewhere? Was it a tragedy? If so, from whose perspective?
[[Jameson, Fredric]]'s concept
of [[metacommentary]] takes a
similar approach to the analysis of [[critical theory]].
