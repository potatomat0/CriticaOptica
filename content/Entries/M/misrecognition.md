[[misrecognition]]
(*m√©connaissance*) A process of self-identification in which a
[[subject]] assumes an
identity they mistake for their own. The concept derives from [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s account of the
[[mirror stage]] of childhood
development in which the young child (under 18 months) sees itself in
the mirror and mistakes that image for itself. While the image in the
mirror is obviously an image *of* them, it isn't *actually* them, but
the child fails to make this distinction. Thus the child's 'I' is the
product of its [[imaginary]]
and the result of an illusion. Marxist critic [[Althusser, Louis]] adapts this idea
in the development of his concept of
[[interpellation]], which
holds that [[society]]
constantly calls on its subjects to adopt a particular
[[identity]] (citizen,
consumer, voter, etc.). But in doing so the subject is
[[displacement]] from their
'true' self.
