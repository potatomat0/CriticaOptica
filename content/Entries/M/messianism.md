[[messianism]]

 The belief that
a divine saviour will return to earth and 'save' the true believers.
This concept was brought into prominence in [[critical theory]] by the work of German
philosopher [[Benjamin, Walter]]. In his late
essay, 'Theses on the Philosophy of History' (included in the collection of his essays selected by [[Arendt, Hannah]], *Illuminations* (1968)), Benjamin compares the moment of revolutionary rupture to that of
the arrival of the messiah. Messianism has since become a code word in
political philosophy for the belief that history is not a continuum that
progresses inexorably from one moment to the next, but is instead a
series of punctuations. [[Derrida, Jacques]]'s work on Benjamin
focuses almost exclusively on this aspect of his work.
