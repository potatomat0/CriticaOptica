[[Marx, Karl]] 
(1818--83)


German Jewish economist and social theorist and one of the most
influential thinkers of all time. Marx was born in the Rhineland town of
Trier shortly after it was returned to Prussian rule. As the Prussian
state was much less tolerant of Jews than were its previous rulers, the
French, Marx's father converted to Christianity in order to continue to
be able to work as a lawyer. Marx studied law at the Universities of
Bonn and Berlin, but despite his father's wishes he never became a
lawyer.
He obtained a PhD from the University of Jena, but the political
situation in Prussia made it impossible for him to pursue an academic
career, so he instead turned to journalism and took a job with the
Cologne‐based liberal newspaper *Rheinische Zeitung*, becoming its
editor at the age of 24. It was in the offices of the *Rheinische Zeitung* that he met his future collaborator and benefactor [[Engels, Friedrich]] in 1842. Marx used
his editorial position to publicly critique the monarchical state, which
retaliated by censoring his columns and effectively forcing the paper to
close. Following the closure of the *Rheinische Zeitung*, Marx took
another editorial job in Paris in 1843, hoping to find there greater
freedom to write and think. Marx's so-called 'early writings', *On the
Jewish Question* (1843), *A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's
'Philosophy of Right'* (1843--4), and *Economic and Philosophical
Manuscripts* (1844), among other works, date from this period.
These early works set the philosophical tone for much of what followed
by initiating Marx's attack on philosophy (particularly Hegelian
philosophy) for proceeding from the abstract to the concrete, i.e. from
ideas about reality to reality, and not the other way round. This way of
proceeding, he argued, encourages the passive acceptance of injustice
because it equates actual states of things with the ideal state of
things. He also rejected Hegel's use of the term 'spirit' as a way of
narrating human history as the evolution of consciousness because it
obscures actual human agency. As Marx would later insist, humans make
history, but not in conditions of their own choosing. For Hegel's
evolution of consciousness Marx substituted the real historical
processes of economic production, exploited labour, ruling classes, and
class struggle. In contrast to idealist philosophers like Hegel, Marx's
work responded to the transformations of society then being brought
about by the growing industrialization of the economy that was sweeping
across Europe thanks to the heady combination of new productive
technologies (such as the steam engine) and the global expansion of
markets (due to colonialism).
Expelled from France in 1845, Marx moved to Brussels. There he became
involved with the international movement, the Communist League. The
League held two conferences in London in 1847, following which Marx and
Engels (who had already begun collaborating on an unfinished project
that was later published as *The German Ideology*) were assigned the
task of preparing a manifesto to guide the nascent movement. Engels
wrote the initial drafts, and Marx wrote up the final manuscript, which
was published in German in London in 1848. A French translation soon
followed, as did an English translation in 1850. Yet, despite the fact
that 1848 was a turbulent year in Europe (the insurrection in Paris,
which affected both Baudelaire and Flaubert so deeply, being the most
prominent), *Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei*, translated as *The Manifesto of the Communist Party* (1850) had little immediate impact on
revolutionary thought or practice. Ultimately, though, it would become
one of the most influential and indeed consequential books ever written,
as the Communist revolutions of the twentieth century unfolded. That
many of these turned out to be disastrous for millions of people rather
than the liberating triumphs Marx and Engels predicted cannot be blamed
on them, though it frequently is.
*The* *Communist Manifesto* contended not only that capitalist
production was exploitative of labour, but that it was transforming
society itself by overturning traditional forms of production, social
ties, and the old hierarchies of social relations. Presciently, they
argued that this new form of industrial capitalism was creating world
history for the first time (or what we would now term
[[globalization]]) because
now all industrial nations were so interlinked for the production of
goods that no one nation was any longer capable of satisfying all its
needs. Surprisingly, perhaps, Marx and Engels saw these transformations
in a positive light: to their eyes, capitalism benefited society by
smashing all the old traditions, which they saw as suffocating, and by
expanding the productive capacity of society, thus ending worries about
food security and creating full employment. But it was also only the
first step towards a proletarian revolution in which the people would
rise up and take control of this newly created society.
Owing to the failure of the liberal revolutions in Europe in 1848 and
1849, both Marx and Engels were forced to flee to England, where they
remained until their deaths. Engels found employment in the family firm,
overseeing its interests in textile manufacturing and marketing in
Manchester. Supported by Engels, Marx settled in London, near to the
vast resources of the library in the British Museum, which opened in
1857 and contained over 40 kilometres of shelving (the library itself
has since been moved to St Pancras, but Marx's favourite desk is
preserved in the now mummified 'reading room'). Marx also wrote hundreds
of short articles for various English and German newspapers on diverse
topics of contemporary and historical interest, including Britain's
imperial occupation of India. His notebooks from the winter of 1857--8,
largely compiled whilst seated in the British Museum, were published
posthumously as the *Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie
(Rohentwurf)* (1939), translated as *Grundrisse: Foundations of the
Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft)* (1973). Here one sees Marx
throw off the influence of Hegel once and for all and begin the process
that would lead to the writing of his master work *Das Kapital: Kritik
der Politischen Ökonomie* (Capital: Critique of Political Economy).
From the *Grundrisse* onwards Marx's work became increasingly minutely
focused on the precise economic mechanisms of the capitalist system,
which he always understood in political terms. He admired the productive
capacity of capitalism and the way it unleashed tremendous productive
forces, but he also saw that the system was innately unequal in its
distribution of prosperity and ultimately exploitative. More
importantly, perhaps, Marx also saw that the logic of capitalist
production was such that it was bound to swing from one crisis to
another because its very premise, namely the endless pursuit of profit,
was destabilizing. Throughout the 1860s Marx worked on, but never
completed and only sporadically published, what would come to be known
simply as *Das Kapital*. The first volume appeared in 1867, and was the
only volume to appear in Marx's lifetime; the other two volumes were
published posthumously under Engels's editorship (a fourth volume was
written, but it was published by [[Kautsky, Karl]] under the separate
title of *Theories of Surplus Value*) in 1884 and 1894 respectively.
His aim in writing *Das Kapital* was to understand how capitalism works
as a political system, not just an economic system. At the centre of
this book, though, is Marx's fascination with the enigma of the
commodity: it is an enigma because people willingly pay more for certain
commodities than their use value dictates. He described this situation
as a kind of [[fetishism]].
For example, as Naomi Klein demonstrated in her book *No Logo* (2000),
people pay substantially more for certain items because they have a
particular brand label attached to them, even though the same
item---minus the brand---could be had for a much lower cost. Thus, he
argued, commodities have to be understood in terms of exchange value
(what someone is willing to pay for something) and not use value (the
material value of an item calculated in terms of what could be done with
it). But if something is valuable only in terms of exchange---if it is
the exchange that determines its value---then the thing no longer has
any intrinsic value, thus raising the question: What then gives it
value? His somewhat cryptic answer is labour conceived as socially
useful time (and not just physical or mental effort)---labour to produce
the commodity (which is seen as dead or stored labour) and labour to
acquire the capital to purchase the commodity.
Marx's health deteriorated throughout the 1870s, slowing down his rate
of work, which had always been prodigious and painstaking, preventing
him from finishing his project. Fortunately Engels was able to oversee
his legacy. Marx's influence on [[critical theory]] is immense, albeit
uneven. Indeed, his legacy can be seen in the very constitution of
critical theory, particularly in its earliest formulation by the
[[Frankfurt School]], in the
attention it gives to the real-world considerations of economics and
politics. His work has also had a significant influence on literary
criticism, via the work of artists like [[Brecht, Bertolt]] and scholars such
as [[Lukács, György]], [[Macherey, Pierre]], [[Eagleton, Terry]], [[Jameson, Fredric]], and others, and
history, through the work of [[Anderson, Perry]] and [[Hobsbawm, Eric]], among many
others. Philosophers like [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], and [[Deleuze, Gilles]] all claim as an
essential resource Marx's contribution to political thought. Like any
great thinker, Marx has given rise to rival schools of thought, some of
which---like [[Althusser, Louis]]'s
followers---became highly influential in their own right, as well as
powerful opponents. Outside academia, Marx's work has proven to be a
powerful intellectual and ideological weapon in the hands of the
oppressed everywhere.
