[[mimicry]]

 A term used in
[[Postcolonial Studies]] to
describe the paradoxical (or doubly articulated) state of affairs in
colonial countries whereby the colonial power desires its subjugated
others, namely the indigenous population of the occupied country, to
look or at least act the same as the occupiers and yet fear that very
outcome because it would dilute their own sense of difference and
superiority. Mimicry is thus, as [[Bhabha, Homi]] theorizes, an
ambivalent strategy whereby
[[subaltern]] peoples
simultaneously express their subservience to the more powerful and
subvert that power by making mimicry seem like mockery. A contemporary
form of this can be seen today in the way in which call centre jobs from
Australia, the UK, US, and elsewhere are exported to India precisely
because as a direct result of colonization there are operators there who
can mimic English speakers from those countries.
