[[Marxist Criticism]]

 A form of
cultural criticism that applies Marxist
[[theory]] to the
interpretation of cultural texts. Since neither [[Marx, Karl]] nor his collaborator
[[Engels, Friedrich]] ever
developed a specific form of cultural criticism themselves, Marxist
Criticism has been extrapolated from their writings. As there is no one
form of [[Marxism]], so there
is no one form of Marxist Criticism. This is not to say that the
different variants of Marxist Criticism do not have certain features in
common, but it is nevertheless also true that there is considerable
debate within the field concerning those differences. In common, then,
all forms of Marxist Criticism assume the following: (i) that no
artistic object can be understood in isolation from the social,
cultural, and historical conditions in which it was produced; (ii) that
all categories by which artistic objects might be measured are
themselves constructions that need to be evaluated from the perspective
of the social, cultural, and historical conditions that gave rise to
them; (iii) that all artistic productions are commodities that can and
must be understood in terms of the production of surplus value; (iv)
that art is a site for the playing out of a
[[symbolic]] form of [[class struggle]].
The principle area of difference in Marxist Criticism is the issue of
whether or not it should be prescriptive or not: in other words, is it
the job of Marxist Criticism to determine what art should be like? There
have been powerful movements in favour of this position---the most noted
is of course [[socialist realism]]. This position has
also been championed very strongly by such critics as [[Lukács, György]]. But there is a
similarly powerful movement against it and in recent years it has
generally been agreed that it is neither possible nor desirable to
prescribe what art should be like. But if that isn't the task of Marxist
Criticism, then what is? As is the case with
[[psychoanalysis]], the
response to this question is twofold: there is an attempt to understand
the nature of the object (i.e. what makes it art and why) and alongside
it there is the attempt to understand the subject's response to
particular art objects. In both cases, the primary conceptual tool is
the notion of [[ideology]].
Some of the major Marxist critics are: [[Eagleton, Terry]], his *Marxism and
Literary Criticism* (1976) was immensely influential; [[Jameson, Fredric]], his *Marxism and
Form* (1971), and more particularly *The Political Unconscious* (1981),
are perhaps the most sophisticated attempts to synthesize the critical
methodologies from a broad spectrum of approaches; Lukács, although a
troubled figure, his *History and Class Consciousness* (1923) continues
to be studied today and it is in many ways a foundational text for the
field; [[Macherey, Pierre]],
whose *Pour une théorie de la production littéraire*, translated as *A Theory of Literary Production* (1978), is generally regarded as the
definitive application of
[[Althusser, Louis]]'s work to
literature; and [[Williams, Raymond]], a hugely
influential figure, particularly in the nascent field of [[Cultural Studies]].
