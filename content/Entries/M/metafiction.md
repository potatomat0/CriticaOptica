[[metafiction]]

 Fiction that
draws attention to and directly comments upon its status as fiction.
Most often this takes the form of an intrusion of the 'author' into the
work. One of the earliest and most celebrated cases of metafiction is
Laurence Sterne's *Tristram Shandy* (1760--7), which has the author
commenting frequently on his failure to get on with telling the story.
But it can also take the form of a work of fiction about either the
reading or writing of fiction, as one finds (again quite famously) in
[[Calvino, Italo]]'s *Se una
notte d'inverno un viaggatore* (1979), translated as *If on a Winter's
Night a Traveller* (1981). The device is more common in late
twentieth-century fiction writing than it is in earlier periods and for
this reason is often associated with
[[postmodernism]], although
there is no direct correlation between the two. The device can also be
witnessed in film and television.

Self-Conscious Fiction* (1988).
