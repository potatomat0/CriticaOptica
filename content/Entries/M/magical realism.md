[[magical realism]]

 A style of
literature which integrates a
[[seriality]] mode of writing
with fantastical or marvellous events treated as perfectly ordinary
occurrences. The term derives from a mistranslation of Cuban writer
Alejo Carpentier's notion 'lo real maravilloso' (marvellous reality),
which occurs in the prologue to *El Reino de este Mundo* (1949),
translated as *The Kingdom of This World* (1957), where it is used to
characterize the life of the people Carpentier encountered on a visit to
Haiti. The key here is that the aim is to describe a reality in which
the magical is part of [[everyday life]] and not an
extraordinary dimension. Thus, it should not be confused with either the
fantastic (as [[Todorov, Tzvetan]] defines it) or
fantasy fiction, because its purpose is not simply to go beyond the
bounds of realism. As is evident in the best-known examples of magical
realism, namely Gabriel García Márquez's novel, *Cien años de soledad*
(1967), translated as *One Hundred Years of Solitude* (1970), and Salman
Rushdie's *Midnight's Children* (1981), there is a distinct political
purpose behind introducing the marvellous, which sets it apart from the
merely fantastic. At its best, as in Márquez and Rushdie, but one can
also cite the work of Mikhail Bulgakov, Angela Carter, and Günter Grass,
the device of magical realism (as the [[Russian Formalism]] would undoubtedly
call it) enables the writer to critique belief, memory, and the
imagination as historical forces.
