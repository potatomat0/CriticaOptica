[[Marxism]]

 The political
[[discourse]] and a
revolutionary [[social movement]] inspired by the
work of [[Marx, Karl]]. At its
most elementary, Marxism is a science of history premised on the view
that the economy, or more precisely the [[mode of production]], determines and
decides the conditions of existence for all people. There is a
[[utopia]] dimension to it
as well inasmuch as its basic conviction is that the needs of all people
should be met by [[society]].
In the capitalist mode of production, however, this is impossible
because there is a divide between the owners of the means of production
and the workers who must sell their labour to survive---the relationship
between the two, which Marx refers to as a [[class struggle]], is fundamentally
iniquitous in Marx's view. Marx theorized that once workers became aware
of this inequality and the fact that it could not be overcome without
making changes to the very mode of production that they would rise up in
protest and overturn capitalism and replace it with socialism. History
proved him wrong on this last count. The history of Marxism as a
revolutionary social movement begins with the founding of the First
International in 1864 and to a certain degree ends with the fall of the
Berlin Wall in 1989. In between, of course, there were three more
Internationals as well as highly successful revolutions in Russia,
China, Korea, and Cuba. As a form of political discourse, Marxism has
had a varied history---it experienced a major rupture following the
Russian Revolution in 1917. Marxist scholars in the western parts of
Europe felt cut off from the events in Russia, but also felt defeated by
the failure of revolution to occur in their own country. A new form of
Marxism, generally known as [[Western Marxism]], emerged at this
point and to a certain degree developed independently of the more
pragmatic version of Marxism that obtained in the USSR. *See also*
