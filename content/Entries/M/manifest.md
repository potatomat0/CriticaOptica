[[manifest]]

 and latent content
In *Die Traumdeutung* (1900), translated as *The Interpretation of
Dreams* (1953), [[Freud, Sigmund]] calls the dream that
the [[analysand]] or patient
recalls the manifest content because this is how the dream appears to
them; but, he argues, that appearance conceals a deeper truth, which he
calls the latent content, and designates as the dream's thought. It is
latent in the sense that it is implicit in the manifest content, but
because of the transformations and distortions enacted by the
[[dreamwork]] it is for all
intents and purposes invisible. It is the latent content that his
analysis seeks to reveal.
