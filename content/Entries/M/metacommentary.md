[[metacommentary]]

 American
cultural critic [[Jameson, Fredric]]'s term for his
comparative analysis of competing interpretive methods. Jameson says
that the metacommentary implies a model not unlike [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s conception of the
relationship between the symptom and its underpinning, but repressed
idea (minus his theory of the
[[libido]], of course). The
content of a text is the distorted product of lived experience subject
to censorship---there are always certain ideas, thoughts, phrases, and
so forth that are not appropriate in a particular historical context so
they have to be distorted to escape that censorship. This is Freud's
basic idea for dream analysis: dreams are distorted images of our
unconscious thoughts created in such a way as to escape censorship. So
understanding a text means coming to grips with this process of
censorship, which Jameson suggests can be accomplished by means of a
reconstruction of its original context. What must be explained, then, is
why a particular text had to be distorted in that way. A simple, literal
example of this is the much discussed effects of the Hays Code on
Hollywood: for instance, since the act of sex could not be depicted
explicitly, visual metaphors for it had to be found, hence the famous
smoking in bed scene following the first kiss which became a universal
symbol of sex. In his later works, Jameson tends to use the term
[[dialectical criticism]]
rather than metacommentary to describe his analytic approach. *See also*
