[[metaphor]]

 A figure in
[[rhetoric]] in which the
meaning of one word is transferred onto and in a certain sense combined
with that of another. It is constructed in the same manner as a simile,
but the comparative terms 'like' and 'as' are removed. So instead of
saying 'that man behaves like a pig' one says 'that man is a pig' and in
so doing the attributes of the pig (generally the disagreeable ones) are
transposed onto the man. Metaphors can also take extended forms, from a
few a paragraphs to entire books---Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*
(1902), for instance, is often read as an extended metaphor for
imperialism and its effects.
