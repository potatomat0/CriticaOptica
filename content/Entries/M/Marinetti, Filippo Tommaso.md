[[Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso]]
(1876--1944) Italian author best known as the founder of
[[Futurism]]. He shot to
international prominence when his short and provocative text 'The
Founding and Manifesto of Futurism' was published on the front page of
the French daily newspaper *Le Figaro* in 1909. It celebrated art as
violence, cruelty, and injustice; it called for the destruction of
museums and libraries; and it glorified war as a kind of cultural
hygiene. His reputation is, however, more than a little tarnished by his
enthusiastic, albeit idealistic, support for Mussolini's fascist regime.
He even tried, unsuccessfully, to make Futurism the official art of
Italian fascism. Today Marinetti is generally remembered, particularly
by Paul Virilio, as a prophet of speed.
