[[matheme]]

 French
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s term for his
equations, graphs, schemata, and symbols which function like
[[Marxism]] in his thinking
and teaching. One finds similar notations in the work of [[Badiou, Alain]], who similarly
treats mathematical equations as an
[[ontology]]. In both cases,
the matheme is used in preference to language, which is by implication
deemed too imprecise to express a particular problem or concept.
