[[mobility studies]]

 A movement
in [[Cultural Studies]] and
human geography concerned with mobility in the most broadly understood
sense of that word---not just the movement of things, people, and ideas,
but also both the means of moving things, people, and ideas and the
actual fact and, more especially, the experience of moving as well as
attitudes towards moving. In *On the Move: Mobility in the Western
World* (2006) Tim Cresswell argues that mobility is the dynamic
equivalent of [[place]],
which is to say it is a form of movement that is in a certain sense
socially produced and imbued with meaning and perhaps most importantly
embodied. Cresswell suggests that mobility can be thought of as a way of
being in the world. In an edited volume explicitly produced as a
manifesto for mobility studies, *Cultural Mobility: A Manifesto* (2009),
[[Greenblatt, Stephen]]
identifies five key principles underpinning the field: firstly, it
should take mobility literally and examine the huge varieties of forms
of movement as well as the routes movement takes---it should look at the
speed of travel, the limits to travel, and so on; secondly, it should
look at licit and illicit forms of mobility, that which takes place in
plain sight and that which is hidden (e.g. people smuggling); thirdly,
it should identify [[contact zone]], places where the
different trajectories mobility can take cross-over with one another,
producing new and unexpected syntheses and mixtures (e.g. Filipino
adobo-style food, which is Mexican in origin, a by-product of the
galleon trade); fourthly, it should illuminate the tension between
agency and constraint, the ability to control movement, and the
restrictions placed on movement (e.g. asylum seekers who can perhaps
escape their own country but cannot enter another country); lastly, it
should analyse rootedness and belonging, the different ways people are
anchored to a particular location and carry that with them when they
move.
