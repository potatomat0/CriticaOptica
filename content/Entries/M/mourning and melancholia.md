[[mourning and melancholia]]

 In
short paper entitled 'Trauer und Melancholie' (1917). later translated
as 'Mourning and Melancholie' (1925),
[[Freud, Anna]] set out to try to
account for the different psychological work carried out by these mental
states. It is doubtless no coincidence that he should turn his attention
to this topic at the height of the First World War, when the newspapers
daily published long lists of soldiers killed in action. In linking
mourning and melancholia Freud proposed to show that melancholia is a
pathological form of mourning, which he describes as a normal
[[affect]]. He defines
mourning as a reaction to the loss of a loved one (human or non-human)
or the loss of an abstract thing such as a country, ideal, or one's
freedom. Although its affects may be severe, Freud notes, we never
regard it as pathological and expect it to be overcome after a suitable
period of time. By contrast, melancholia is to be regarded as
pathological, even though it may have the precise same cause, e.g. loss
of a loved one or thing. Melancholia is characterized by a profoundly
painful sense of dejection, Freud says, which is accompanied by a loss
of interest in the outside world, a loss of the capacity and feeling for
love, a general lassitude, and a loss of self-regard. Mourners
experience all of these symptoms, too, Freud says, with one key
exception: the loss of self-regard.
Freud describes the inner working of mourning as follows: once it is
clear to the subject that their loved object no longer exists, they feel
compelled to withdraw their
[[liminality]] attachment to
that object. But this demand---understandably---is met with
resistance---we do not want to give up on our loved object. The
opposition to this demand can be so strong that, rather than face up to
the reality of our loss, we cling to the object in a hallucinated form,
a process Freud describes as 'wishful psychosis'. Eventually the
[[ego]] is able to break free
from this cycle of disbelief and make its peace with reality.
Melancholia has a similar inner working, but differs in that the actual
cause of it may not be fully known by the subject: it is usually
triggered by a feeling of loss, but it is not always clear to the
subject what exactly it is that they have lost. The loss is
[[unconscious]] in this case,
whereas for mourning the loss is always fully conscious. The effect too
is quite different: for the mourner, the world feels empty in the
absence of their loved object, while, for the melancholic, it is their
ego---their inner world---that feels empty; hence the powerful feeling
of self-reproach that attaches to melancholia. Today we would recognize
Freud's portrayal of melancholia as a reasonably standard account of
depression.
Freud returned to this topic in his paper 'Das Ich und das Es' (1923)
translated as 'The Ego and the Id' (1927). For Freud, the real interest
in thinking about melancholia is the way it makes apparent the way the
ego can take itself as an object---this idea is central to
[[narcissism]] as well. It is
thus central to his thinking with regard to the formation of the
psychical agencies such as the ego and the id. Freud theorizes the work
of melancholia as follows: an attachment to a loved object is shattered
when that object resists or rejects that attachment (for example, a
friend may slight us in some real or imagined way); but rather than
withdraw the libido from that object and displace it onto a different
object (as we would in mourning), we turn that libido back onto
ourselves, with the result that the ego forms an identification with the
spurned object. The lost object is duplicated on the inside, and the
pain of loss is thereby avoided by the power of this internalized
[[simulacrum]]. By the same
token, the hatred we feel for ourselves---which according to Freud we
actually enjoy---is a displaced form of hatred for the other who has
rejected our attachment.
Melancholics revenge themselves on their lost love objects via a process
we would today label self-harm. For this reason, Freud also links
anorexia to melancholia. Freud's analysis of the metapsychology (his
term) of mourning and melancholia has been very influential in critical
theory, especially in the work of [[Benjamin, Walter]] and [[Butler, Judith]]. In her essay on
Benjamin, 'Under the Sign of Saturn' (1978), Susan Sontag wrote that one
cannot really understand his work until one grasps how deeply it relies
on a theory of melancholy. In her view, his work reflected his
character, which, she thought, evidenced profound melancholic traits.
His writing on Proust, Kafka, and even Goethe and Walser all hinge, she
argues, on the way their work dwells on melancholic topics, especially
the emotions associated with forced solitude or, more particularly, the
sense that one does not belong. Nowhere is the importance of melancholy
to Benjamin's thinking clearer than in his failed PhD thesis, *Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels* (1928), translated as *The Origin of German
Tragic Drama* (1977). Benjamin argued that *Trauerspiele* (or 'sorrow
plays', as Sontag translates them) are allegories of historical
catastrophe turned in on themselves.
In an early work, *Gender Trouble* (1990), Judith Butler produced a
striking rereading of Freud by linking mourning and melancholia to the
[[Oedipus complex]], arguing
that melancholy is central to the development of homosexual identity. As
Butler notes, the formation of the sexual identity, which for Freud
means overcoming primary bisexuality, requires the subject to give up at
least one object of their affection, namely the parent of the same sex.
Freud's assumption is that this turning away from the object of the same
sex is natural, but Butler argues that it is more likely to be a product
of the prohibition on same-sex relations that were current in Freud's
time and to a certain extent today. The heterosexual subject is
therefore a product of prohibition, rather than the primary or default
position. Meanwhile the homosexual subject, on this reading, is the
product of the disavowed grief at the loss of the same-sex object and
its subsequent internalization.
As Butler notes, both [[Kristeva, Julia]] and [[Irigaray, Luce]] have devoted
works to the topic of melancholy. Kristeva's work, *Soleil Noir:
Dépression et mélancolie* (1987), translated as *Black Sun: Depression
and Melancholia* (1992), which draws on [[Klein, Melanie]], is focused on
motherhood, arguing that melancholy is the matricidal impulse turned
against the self. Its affect is a kind of voluptuous sadness which in
certain circumstances is
[[desublimation]] to form art.
For Irigaray, melancholia is the psychological norm for women in the
Freudian universe because their character is supposedly defined by the
'lost' penis they never had. It is therefore a model of identity
formation she rejects.
