[[McLuhan, Herbert Marshall]]
(1911--80) Canadian media theorist, one of the most influential
intellectuals of his time. Born in Edmonton, McLuhan grew up in
Winnipeg. He completed a BA and MA in English at the University of
Manitoba, then he went to Cambridge to complete a PhD in English
Literature. When he arrived in the UK he found that Cambridge did not
recognize his Canadian degrees, so he was forced to start all over
again. At Cambridge he studied under [[Richards, Ivor Armstrong]] and [[James, C. L. R.]]. He returned to
North America in 1937 to take a position at St Louis University and
continue working towards his PhD, which he finally completed in 1943.
Published in 1951 as *The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man*
McLuhan's thesis explores the changing nature of
[[rhetoric]] in contemporary
culture. In 1944 he returned to his native Canada, where he spent almost
all of the remainder of his professional career. In the early 1950s
McLuhan turned his attention increasingly towards communication and
media, tracking the rise of what would later be known as the [[consumer society]]. McLuhan's career
took off in the early 1960s with the publication of a number of books
that would transform him into an academic superstar: *The Gutenberg
Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man* (1962); *Understanding Media: The
Extensions of Man* (1964); *The Medium is the Message: An Inventory of
Effects* (1967), and *War and Peace in the Global Village* (1968).
McLuhan's work saw past the content to the form---he grasped before
almost anybody else that new media technology did not just mean new ways
of distributing old or familiar content; it meant a whole new way of
thinking and being in the world. His concept of the 'global village' has
been widely adopted as a description of the world as it is in
consequence of the processes of
[[globalization]].
Consequently, although he died decades before the Internet became part
of [[everyday life]], he is
generally seen as one of its key prophets. His work was enormously
influential too on [[Cultural Studies]], particularly in its
formative stages.
