[[mimesis]]

 The imitation of
nature. Both Plato and Aristotle wrote extensively about mimesis, and
both were worried about its capacity to present the truth in contrast to
the more reliable form of philosophy. In classical literature, mimesis
is the opposite of
[[diegesis]] in that it
refers to the attempt by an author to speak in a voice other than their
own, specifically a character's. In more recent critical discourse
mimesis has become a code phrase for
[[realism]], or more
precisely works of art that attempt to present reality in its most
[[everyday life]] and mundane
sense. The famous debate in the 1930s between [[Brecht, Bertolt]] and [[Lukács, György]], two of the
twentieth century's most important [[Marxist Criticism]], centred on the
relative artistic value of mimesis, with Lukács arguing in favour of it,
saying it was necessary to get away from the tales of aristocracy if the
truth of society was to be told, and Brecht arguing against it by saying
that the imitation of reality dulled the audience's mind and instead
what they needed was to be shocked (the so-called
[[estrangement-effect]]). In
the immediate aftermath of World War II, and perhaps in response to the
shock of the war itself, mimesis was foregrounded as the pinnacle of
artistic achievement, especially in literature, by Eric Auerbach's
magisterial book *Mimesis* (1953), which showed that the goal of art
since the earliest times had been to represent nature just as it is. In
critical theory, mimesis has been important to a range of scholars, but
most notably French
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Lacan, Jacques]], and after him
(adapting his ideas), the
[[collocation]] critics
[[Bhabha, Homi]] and [[Taussig, Michael]], who see in it the
origins for a theory of
[[resistance]]. Bhabha, in
particular, plays on the idea that the
[[subaltern]], by imitating
the [[hegemony]] other, i.e.
the colonial master, escapes scrutiny and thereby creates the conditions
necessary for political subversion. By the same token, inasmuch as the
subaltern looks like their master in manner and dress, they compel the
master to recognize that the
[[Other]] looks like them.
