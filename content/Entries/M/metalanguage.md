[[metalanguage]]

 Language about
language. In this sense, virtually all of linguistics and all of
literary criticism falls into the category of metalanguage inasmuch as
both disciplines are essentially concerned with using language to write
about and understand language use. Understood in this rather
straightforward fashion the concept poses no real difficulties, but if
one takes it literally, then as critics like [[Derrida, Jacques]] show, you have a
real problem because how can language be outside of itself? It is in
effect a logical fallacy to suggest it.
