[[moral criticism]]

 A
tendency---rather than a recognized school---within literary criticism
to judge literary works according to moral rather than formal
principles. Moral criticism is not necessarily censorious or
'moralizing' in its approach, although it can be; nor does it
necessarily imply a Christian perspective, although it often does. Moral
critics include D. H. Lawrence, whose position was pagan, and extolled
the virtue of 'life' as a force to be nourished through literature; T. S
Eliot, who was Christian, and judged works in terms of their ability to
clarify life, and give it meaning; [[James, C. L. R.]], who thought
literature should be 'improving', that by reading it one should become a
better person. Moral criticism is also concerned with the 'seriousness'
of a work and whether its purpose is worthy of its means---it is from
this perspective than one speaks of such things as 'gratuitous' sex in a
novel, or nudity in a film, when it isn't seen to serve the moral
purpose of the narrative.
