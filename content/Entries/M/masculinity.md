[[masculinity]]

 The culturally
relative ideal [[gender]]
[[identity]] for men. Studies
of masculinity, a now quite considerable body of work, show that the
specific nature of masculinity varies across time and geography---men in
nineteenth-century Britain were expected to act and behave quite
differently from the way they are expected to act and behave today;
similarly, in the twenty-first-century men in Britain are expected to
act and behave quite differently from men in Iraq. Thus, it is more
usual in critical discourse to speak of masculinity in the plural rather
than the singular. The study of masculinity is an offshoot of the study
of [[gender]] pioneered in
[[feminism]] and [[Cultural Studies]], and as such its
research has at its core the problem of identity formation. In
particular it has overturned the idea of [[biological determinism]] which holds that
gendered behaviour is a function of physiology---e.g. men are stronger
and more aggressive than women and are therefore naturally supposed to
be hunter-warriors---and shown very clearly that masculinity is
culturally defined. Research in the field has been greatly influenced by
[[Butler, Judith]]'s concept
of performativity (which she derives from [[Austin, John Langshaw]]'s linguistic
concept of the
[[performative]]), which
claims that all gender roles are performances requiring constant
self-management. Along the same lines, some researchers have wanted to
argue that men are under just as much stress to conform to cultural
expectations of the ideal body as women, though many in
[[feminism]] see this as
overstating things since in most parts of the world the
[[patriarchy]] is still
firmly in place.
