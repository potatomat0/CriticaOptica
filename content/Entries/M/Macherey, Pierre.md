[[Macherey, Pierre]]
 (1938--)


French literary theorist. He was born in Belfort, in the Franche-Comté
region. Macherey attended the École Normale Supérieure from 1958 to
1963, where he met [[Althusser, Louis]] with whom he
would work very closely for a number of years. He completed an MA in
1961 on Spinoza (a lifelong interest) under the direction of [[Canguilhem, Georges]]. In 1962--3,
Macherey, along with fellow students [[Balibar, Étienne]], [[Pêcheux, Michel]], and [[Rancière, Jacques]], undertook a
year-long study of the then still relatively new critical methodology
[[structuralism]] under the
direction of Althusser. Next the group tackled [[Marx, Karl]]'s *Das Kapital*,
eventually publishing a long multi-authored volume entitled *Lire le
capital* (1968), partially translated as *Reading Capital* (1970). In
the ensuing years, as the group disintegrated over personal, political,
and theoretical differences, the contributions by Macherey and Rancière
were deleted. In 1966, Macherey published *Pour une théorie de la
production littéraire*, translated as *A Theory of Literary Production*
(1978), which for many readers is not only his most important work, but
also the most enduring example---at least in literary studies---of an
Althusserian approach to textual analysis. In subsequent work, Macherey
focused on Spinoza, completing a five-volume interpretation of his
*Ethics* in 1998.
