[[Metz, Christian]] 
(1931--93)


French film theorist. Metz introduced film studies to both
[[structuralism]] and
[[psychoanalysis]] and in the
process helped initiate the establishment of film theory. Instead of
asking what films mean, Metz set out to discover how they make meaning,
and in doing so revolutionized the way film was written and thought
about in the academy. Born in Béziers in southern France, Metz studied
classical languages and ancient history at the École Normale Supérieure
and then completed a doctorate in general linguistics at the Sorbonne.
Always a cinephile, Metz began to think of ways of applying [Ferdinand
de  *Saussure](#X802ebfc67c621d49cc63bbba0a18976b3faf319)'s theories of
language (then much in fashion in Paris thanks to the work of [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] and [[Barthes, Roland]], among others) to
cinema in order to deduce the universal syntax of narrative film. How,
in other words, does a film tell a story in pictures? In the 1970s,
realizing that the structuralist approach to film analysis he had
adopted privileged the cinematic text over the audience, Metz began to
incorporate the insights of psychoanalysis, particularly its
[[anaclisis]] variant (itself
already influenced by structuralism), so as to think through how viewers
receive films. Metz hypothesized that films are the equivalent of dreams
or hallucinations so [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s theory of the
dreamwork can be applied directly to them. This has proved a highly
influential suggestion. Metz's most important publications are *Essai sur la signification au cinéma* (1968), translated as *Film Language: A
Semiotics of the Cinema* (1980) and *Le Signifiant imaginaire.
Psychanalyse et cinéma* (1977), translated as *The Imaginary Signifier:
Psychoanalysis and the Cinema* (1982).
