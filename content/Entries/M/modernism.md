[[modernism]]

 An international
artistic movement, encompassing all the arts from architecture to arts
and crafts, film, and literature, that began in the latter part of the
nineteenth century and finished in the middle of the twentieth century.
It falls between [[realism]],
which it repudiated, and
[[postmodernism]], which was
faced with the task of trying to find something new and interesting to
do after apparently every possible experiment had already been performed
by its predecessor. And it encompasses, albeit uncertainly, a range of
artistic movements, including:
[[Abstractionism]],
[[avant-garde]],
[[constructivism]], cubism,
[[Dada]],
[[Futurism]],
[[Surrealism]], and even
[[Situationism]] (to list
only a few of the many creative factions that flourished during this
period).
Its defining characteristic is captured by two famous phrases: Arthur
Rimbaud's 'Il faut être absolument moderne!' (One must be absolutely
modern!) and Ezra Pound's 'Make it new', both of which enjoin artists to
jettison tradition and experiment with the possibilities inherent in
every medium, regardless of the apparent senselessness or indeed
ugliness of the outcome. Pound's fellow American modernist Gertrude
Stein thought that it was the duty of the work of art to strive for
ugliness because only in that way could it be assured of being truly new
(beauty being a lingering trace of past traditions).
The stem word 'modern', which derives from the Latin '*modo*' (meaning
currently or at the moment), has been in use for nearly two thousand
years. Its usage until the middle of the nineteenth century was
generally unmarked, signalling no particular privilege or significance
save that of currency. In *A Singular Modernity* (2002), [[Jameson, Fredric]] lists fourteen
different uses of the term 'modern' from the Classical period up until
the 1960s. The real question, then, he argues, is when and how did
modern become the demand for the new? There is no straightforward answer
to this question, but it is generally thought (although the details are
hotly disputed) that modernism is the aesthetic complement of
[[modernity]] (change in the
social sphere) and that its drive for change is rooted in the
disruptions to social life brought about by
[[modernization]] (change in
technology). That is to say, it was the changes in the conditions of
daily life that enabled modernism to blossom.
This argument, which was presented powerfully and persuasively by
Marshall Berman in *All that is Solid Melts into Air* (1982), reflects
certain historical facts: modernism was an urban aesthetic---it
celebrated and agonized over the new forms of life (and the various
problems they entail) that the crowded cities of industrializing Europe
afforded. The key change was the
[[alienation]] of individuals
from their families, their villages, and their connection to the land:
factory workers moved to the city to become wage-earners, but in doing
so became separated from everything that they knew and took for granted.
Industrialization was thus a powerful force of change: it changed the
structure of cities, it created a new class of people (the proletariat)
and new things to spend money on (commodities). Ultimately, though, it
was the First World War which brought about the most sweeping changes:
it literally killed off the hidebound traditionalism of the Victorian
era and introduced a new sense of urgency about the need to live life
for all that it had to offer. [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s theory of sexual
repression struck a powerful chord with the post-war generation for
precisely this reason: it sensed personal, social, and cultural
constraints it was no longer prepared to accept or tolerate. It was in
this flux that the first artists began to think of themselves as
modernists and their art as modernism emerged.
Modernism was not a singular enterprise: it varied according to history
and geography, or to put it another way it did not occur in the same way
or at the same time in all countries. It was inspired and repulsed by
the political experiments of the period: communism, fascism, Nazism, and
socialism. Paris led the way, through the work of its poets Charles
Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, and its painters Edouard Manet and Paul
Cézanne, and because of them expatriates like James Joyce, Pablo
Picasso, and Igor Stravinsky flocked there, further enhancing its
reputation. But modernism was a properly global phenomenon, if
predominantly a white Anglo-Saxon male phenomenon, and variants of it
occurred on virtually every continent. The highpoints of modernism are
for the most part still revered and avidly studied today.
