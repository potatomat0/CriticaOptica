[[mentality]] 

(*mentalité*)

 A
historical form of [[collective unconscious]] (extrapolated
from [[Durkheim, Émile]]'s idea of
collective consciousness rather than
[[langue]]'s own concept of
collective unconscious) conceived by the [[Annales School]] of historians in
France to explain how a large population of individual subjects can act
and think in a similar fashion without direct coercion. The concept is
particularly useful for characterizing the apparently spontaneous shift
in national character that precedes revolutions. It is also used to
discuss such [[longue durée]] processes as
secularization.
