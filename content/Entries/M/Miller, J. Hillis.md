[[Miller, J. Hillis]]
(1928--2017) American literary critic (primarily a Victorianist) who was
part of the group of scholars who were known as the [[Yale School of Deconstruction]]. Born in
Virginia, Miller attended Oberlin College and Harvard University,
graduating from the latter in 1952 with a PhD entitled *Symbolic Imagery
in Six Novels of Charles Dickens*. His first appointment was to Johns
Hopkins University, where he remained for twenty years, coming under the
influence of [[Geneva School]] critic Georges
Poulet, who advocated a
[[phenomenology]]
inflected critique of consciousness. He then moved to Yale in 1972,
where he stayed for fourteen years, working with Paul de Man, [[Bloom, Harold]], and Geoffrey
Hartman (1929--2016), moving away from his strictly phenomenological
interests towards deconstruction (as Derrida's various essays on
[[neurosis]] show, these two
approaches are not completely incompatible). He became a key popularizer
of [[deconstruction]],
mediating its move out of French and Comparative Literature departments
into more mainstream English departments. He then moved to the
University of California Irvine, where the originator of deconstruction
[[Derrida, Jacques]] was
based. In 1976, [in a presentation at the annual
MLA](#Xcd714c058f1873d12bf726411768e201c47b186)
(Modern Languages
Association) conference entitled 'The Critic as Host', Miller
effectively summed up his view of deconstruction as a kind of
parasitical practice which dwells within and feeds off, but also
poisons, the text it is working on. The presentation became famous for
the elegant, yet utterly comprehensive way it repudiated M. H. Abrams
attempt to refute deconstruction and in the process showed that when it
comes to the close reading of texts deconstruction is more than a match
for its predecessor [[New Criticism]]. Miller's work
tends to highlight the points of undecidability or tension in texts,
showing that they never quite mean what they say, and somehow always
mean more than they say.
