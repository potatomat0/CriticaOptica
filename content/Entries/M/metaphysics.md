[[metaphysics]]

 The study of
that which lies outside of or beyond the physical realm; (i.e. outside
of the realm of the measurable and indeed the knowable). It aims to know
and describe the world in its totality, including everything that is not
immediately available to the naked eye. It is in this sense inevitably
speculative since it deals with such unknowns and perhaps unknowables as
causality, existence, and possibility. As such, both empirical
philosophers like David Hume and critical philosophers like [[Kant, Immanuel]] have been severe on
metaphysics. The term derives from Aristotle and refers to works he
wrote after his essays on physics. Aristotle himself did not use the
word metaphysics---the subject matter he considered, which has since
been labelled metaphysics, he referred to as 'first philosophy'.
[[Derrida, Jacques]] defines
[[deconstruction]] as a
critique of western metaphysics, which seems to mean the whole of
western philosophy. In contrast, [[Deleuze, Gilles]]'s work might be
thought of as a lifelong attempt to discern the physical underpinnings
of metaphysics.
