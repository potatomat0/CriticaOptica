[[myth criticism]]

 The study of
both myths as literature and literature as myths---in the former case,
myths are read for their own specific literary merit and as historical
precursors to later literary texts (Sophocles' trilogy of plays
surrounding the myth of Oedipus would be one example); in the latter
case, which has been the more influential of the two approaches,
literary texts are read as creative reworkings of myths. A number of
prominent scholars have operated in this field: the most notable are
Mircea Eliade, Leslie Fiedler, [[Frye, Northrop]], René Girard, [[Jung, Carl]], G. Wilson Knight,
and [[Ricœur, Paul]].
