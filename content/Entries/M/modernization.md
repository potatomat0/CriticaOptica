[[modernization]]

 The
transformation of culture and society brought about by embracing a
combination of new ways of thinking and new technology. A highly
problematic concept in sociology and development studies, modernization
theory assumes that all societies are on an evolutionary trajectory
taking them from 'primitive' to 'modern' and that if they are not yet
modern it is because they are reactionary and/or underdeveloped. This is
problematic because it assumes that the western standard of living and
lifestyle is the norm to which all societies should aspire; it also
assumes that the western standard of living and lifestyle is implicitly
the best available (in spite of the contrary evidence from environmental
science). [[modernism]] is
often thought of as a reaction to modernization, a means by which a
particular society can absorb the shocks that rapid and radical change
can cause. Modernization is also of interest to the [**Annales*
School](#X67afb13251965b90031d02df55078760da92cc2) of historians---their
research asks why modernization occurred in one place and not another.
