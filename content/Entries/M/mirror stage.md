[[mirror stage]]

 **(*stade du
miroir*)** The stage of childhood development in which the
[[ego]] is formed according
to [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s
[[psychoanalysis]]. His
theory is based on the so-called 'mirror test' conducted by his friend,
the psychologist Henri Wallon, who compared the reactions to a mirror of
6-month-old human babies with similar aged chimpanzees. What was
noteworthy about the experiment to Wallon, and hence Lacan, was the fact
that the chimpanzees showed only limited interest in their reflection,
whereas the human babies were utterly fascinated. Lacan concluded from
this that the human babies had
[[desiring-machine]] the image
in the mirror as their actual selves. For the first time in their lives,
the babies obtained an image of themselves as a whole (thus creating in
them the [[narcissism]]
sense that before that moment their body was
[[fragmented body]]); by the same
token, the babies see that their body is distinct from both their
environment and the body of others. In this way, too, the subject is
[[displacement]] from itself. It
introduces the subject into the
[[imaginary]] order.
