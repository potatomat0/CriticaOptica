[[mythopoeic]]

 A form of
literature that has the structure, look and feel of a myth, but is in
fact a contemporary creation rather than a story passed down by
tradition. The word was created by one of the genre's great
practitioners, J. R. R. Tolkien, author of *The Lord of the Rings*
(1954--5). Although the bulk of mythopoeic texts tend to be works like
Tolkien's, namely fantasy, this is not exclusively the case. As Richard
Slotkin demonstrates in a powerful work, *Regeneration through Violence*
(1974), works of so-called serious literature to do with the history of
a nation can also be classified as mythopoeic. For example, the cycle of
*Rambo* films taken together offer a potent counter-narrative to
standard accounts of American history---in Rambo's universe the Vietnam
War was won by its soldiers, but lost by the politicians.
