[[multitude]]

 In *Empire*
(2000) and (more explicitly) in *Multitude* (2004), [[Hardt, Michael]] and [[Negri, Antonio]] adapt the Spinozian
term to conceive of a new form of political subjectivity. Consisting of
[[singularity]] rather than
individuals, that is to say social subjects who cannot be reduced to
their [[bare life]], the
multitude is, according to Hardt and Negri, the only form of political
subjectivity capable of realizing democracy for what it truly is, namely
the rule of everyone by everyone. It is an immanent rather than
transcendent concept, so it should not be confused with the idea of a
people---it is not unified, but multiple and plural; by the same token,
it is not anarchic or incoherent, but joined up by power of what its
constituents have in common. Hardt and Negri emphasize the changing
composition of labour, particularly the increase in what they refer to
as [[immaterial labour]], in
support of this point. In the era of the multitude, they argue, race and
gender (among many other possible identity differences) will still be
important, but they will no longer determine hierarchies of power, or,
what amounts to the same thing, regimes of inclusion and exclusion.
Hardt and Negri claim, somewhat problematically (as many commentators
have remarked), that the multitude is constantly being brought into
being by the changes to the composition of capital and society that
capitalism itself is unwittingly bringing about.
