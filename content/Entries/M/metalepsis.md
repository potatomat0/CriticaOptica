[[metalepsis]]

 A second-order
device in [[rhetoric]] in
which one [[metonym]] refers
to another metonym, as for example in the famous description of Helen of
Troy as the 'face that launched a thousand ships'. In
[[narratology]], metalepsis
refers to the collapsing of an embedded tale and the frame narrative,
such as one often finds in
[[postmodern]]
[[metafiction]] (e.g. [[Calvino, Italo]]).
