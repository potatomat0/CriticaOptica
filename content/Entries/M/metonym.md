[[metonym]]

 A type of figure in
[[rhetoric]] in which a part
of a thing, or something closely related to it, is used to represent
that thing. For example 'the Oval Office' and 'the White House' are
often used to represent the US Presidency. Similarly, 'Washington' is
frequently used to represent the US government as a whole.
