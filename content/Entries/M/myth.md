[[myth]]

 **1.** The Swiss
psychoanalyst [[Jung, Carl]]
proposed that the comparative study of myths could be used to understand
and interpret the dreams and hallucinations of psychotic patients. For
Jung myths are metaphors or dramatizations of the inner workings of the
dimension of the [[psyche]]
he calls the [[archetype]],
which in Jungian theory is the inherited part of the mind, namely our
link to the [[collective unconscious]]. In a manner
that Jung thought potentially therapeutic, myths illustrate to us the
dangers of an archetype being given free rein. Myths can thus be treated
as revelations of the structure of the pre-conscious psyche, that is,
the psyche of pure archetypes as yet undomesticated by consciousness.
The crucial implication here is that Jung assumes that the behaviour of
the unconscious resembles the structure of myths, so when mythic
elements appear in the course of treatment they are accorded a high
level of significance. Canadian literary critic [[Frye, Northrop]] adapts Jung's theory
in *Anatomy of Criticism* (1957) to develop his own powerful form of
analysis of literature as essentially mythic.
**2.** The great French anthropologist [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] transformed
the study of myth in a famous essay, 'The Structural Study of Myth'
(1955), which asked the apparently innocent question: if the content of
myths is contingent, if anything can be incorporated into a myth as
seems apparent from the incredible richness of the world's vast
collection of myths created throughout the centuries, then how do we
account for their apparent similarity of form? Lévi-Strauss answers this
question, which encapsulates the
[[structuralism]] approach in
a nutshell, by drawing on the insights of Swiss linguist [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] who observed that
similar sounds recur in different languages, but have different meanings
and argued that in the case of spoken language it is the combination of
sounds (i.e. the form) that is significant, not the specific sounds
themselves (i.e. the content). Applied to myth, as Lévi-Strauss
explains, this logic results in the almost completely opposite view to
Jung---now the elements of a myth (the challenges the hero must face,
the special powers brought to bear, and so on) can be considered
significant only in terms of the combination of their relations with
other elements and not for themselves. The specific combination of
elements will vary from myth to myth, but the way of producing this
combination is unique to myth and universal according to Lévi-Strauss.
Myths have the following constitutive characteristics: they are timeless
or simultaneously historical and ahistorical (e.g. as [[Anderson, Benedict]] argues in his
account of [[imagined community]], although
nations are only a comparatively recent invention in history, they
always present themselves as eternal, as having always been there); they
are the opposite of poetry inasmuch as they can be translated from
language to language, from one type of media to another, without loss of
coherence or consequence (and thus, there is no such thing as the 'true'
or 'original' form of a myth---the myth consists of all its variations
taken together); and they are effective or
[[performative]] (their
telling is itself a kind of message). This last idea has been taken up
by [[Jameson, Fredric]] in
*Signatures of the Visible* (1992) to suggest that contemporary
Hollywood films can be read as symbolic solutions to real problems, and
that is why cinema has such an important place in society today.
**3.** Inspired by [[Brecht, Bertolt]]'s concept of
[[ressentiment]], French
literary critic [[Barthes, Roland]] developed a
concept of myth as a critique of 'naturalness' (i.e. that which appears
to simply occur without any historical determination, just as the sun
does every morning). In a series of short essays initially published in
the cultural journal, *Les Lettres nouvelles*, and subsequently
republished in book form as *Mythologies* (1957), translated as
*Mythologies* (1972), Barthes used myth as a codephrase for that which
'goes without saying' because it is so widely accepted as a 'truth', and
by this means he tried to demonstrate that what passes for 'truth' is in
fact the result of careful
[[glocalization]]
stage-managing. As Barthes puts it in the afterword to *Mythologies*,
the widely read essay 'Myth Today', myth's key principle is to transform
history into nature. In the same essay, Barthes attempted to synthesize
his theory of myth as follows: myth is a special type of speech (by
which he means coded form of language use or communication); myth is not
an object, idea, or concept, but rather a form of signification (it is a
process rather than a thing); anything can be turned into a myth, though
not everything is a myth (they are subject to history); myths are
constructed from material that has already been worked on (they are a
second-order or meta system that uses pre-existing symbols and icons);
myths are not universal, they have to be dealt with in the specificity.
Myths can thus take a variety of different forms---at the end of his
essay, Barthes lists seven common varieties, all of which can be found
in abundance in virtually any newspaper.
