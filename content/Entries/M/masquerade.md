[[masquerade]]

 Used in
[[psychoanalysis]] to
designate the psychological phenomenon of adopting an expected social
role or [[persona]] that
conflicts with an inner desire. It is a way of maintaining appearances
and deflecting attention. It was first used as a concept by the British
psychoanalyst Joan Rivi√®re in a paper entitled 'Womanliness as
Masquerade' (1929), which explores a phenomenon she described as common
in which men and women who are mainly heterosexual display
characteristics typical of the opposite sex. She was particularly
interested, though, in the more complex case whereby women---her main
focus---who desire
[[masculinity]], by which she
seems to mean a masculine position of power, feel they have to
exaggerate their
[[femininity]] in order to
mask their ambition out of fear of retribution from men who would
perceive that desire as castrating. On this view of things, as Mary Ann
Doane has theorized in a widely cited essay published in the film
studies journal *Screen*, 'Film and the Masquerade' (1982), women use
the masquerade of exaggerated femininity in order to disguise their own
misaligned femininity, i.e. a femininity that is composed of a greater
than 'normal' amount of masculinity. In cinema, Doane argues, this type
of femininity is aligned with the character type known as the femme
fatale and is generally treated as evil or, at best, ambivalent.
