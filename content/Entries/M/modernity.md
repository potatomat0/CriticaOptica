[[modernity]]

 The cultural and
social world produced by and in reaction to the processes of
[[modernization]], namely the
advent of new ways of thinking (e.g. secularization) and the emergence
of new technology (e.g. the steam engine). Modernity is used in two main
ways in history and sociology: first, it can refer to any period of
radical change, and in this sense there have been several periods of
so-called modernity dating back to ancient times; second, it can refer
to a very specific moment in history---but there is no general rule or
agreement as to when this moment should be (other than that it should be
one of the moments referred to in the first sense of the word). As
[[Jameson, Fredric]] records
in *A Singular Modernity* (2002), the word 'modern' has been in use
since the fifth century ad and by his reckoning has been used to refer
to at least fourteen periods in history since then. Modernity in this
first sense might be thought of as qualitative in that it refers only to
a change in attitude; in contrast, then, we might thus specify that
modernity in the second sense is quantitative in that it refers to a
change in the very composition of society, not just in its attitudes.
But there would still be the problem of which period counts as genuinely
modern in this expanded sense and historians are divided in this regard
between two principal moments in European history; the end of the 'dark
ages' and the start of the industrial revolution. The choice itself
depends on whether attitudes or technology is foregrounded (arguably,
too, the change in attitudes was a necessary precursor to the invention
of new technology). Generally, though, most uses of the term modernity
tend to refer to the period also known as the Victorian era,
particularly the latter half, i.e. from the 1870s onwards. As Jameson
also points out, modernity is also the back-projection of
[[postmodernism]]---it is the
mythical moment when 'now' began. *See also* [alternate
