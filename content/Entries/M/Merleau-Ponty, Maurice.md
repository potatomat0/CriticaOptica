[[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]]
(1908--61) French philosopher. A key proponent of
[[phenomenology]],
Merleau-Ponty is one of the most important commentators on the work of
[[Husserl, Edmund]]. He was
also one of the first to recognize the significance of the work of Swiss
linguist [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] and is considered
by many to have provided the link from phenomenology to
[[structuralism]].
Undoubtedly, though, Merleau-Ponty is most widely known as a philosopher
of the [[body]].
Born in Rochefort-sur-Mer, he grew up in the Charente-Maritime region,
but studied in Paris, first at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly and then,
following a familiar pathway, the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the
École Normale
Supérieure ([[ANT]]), where his
classmates included [[Beauvoir, Simone de]] and Jean-Paul
Sartre. He completed his studies at the ENS in 1930 and then along with
Beauvoir and [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] began his
teacher training at his alma mater the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly. He was
invited back to the ENS in 1935 to take up a position as tutor and
remained there until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. During these
years he developed his ideas on perception in preparation for his
Doctorat ès Lettres. He also attended the lectures of [[Kojève, Alexandre]]. During the war,
Merleau-Ponty served briefly in the infantry and then following France's
surrender he took an active role in the Resistance.
After the war, Merleau-Ponty's career really took off. Having already
submitted his minor thesis, *La Structure du comportement* (The
Structure of Behaviour), in 1938 (it was published in 1942), he was
finally able to submit his major thesis, *Phénoménologie de la
perception* (1945), translated as *Phenomenology of Perception* (1962).
On the strength of this he was offered a Chair in Child Psychology and
Pedagogy at the Sorbonne. Part of his research for this project was done
at the Husserl archive in Belgium---he was the first French scholar to
visit, he was also instrumental in establishing a Paris-based Husserl
archive as well. In 1946, together with Sartre and Beauvoir,
Merleau-Ponty founded the journal, *Les Temps Modernes*, serving as its
political affairs editor until 1952, when he resigned over disagreements
with the editorial board concerning their support for North Korea's
invasion of South Korea. In the same year he was elevated to a Chair in
Philosophy at the Collège de France, the youngest ever appointment.
Merleau-Ponty's lifelong project was to explain the lived world. He
rejected purely scientific explanations as overly simplified, pointing
out that in their attempt to present realist explanations they rely on
idealist models. Merleau-Ponty rejected virtually all dualisms,
particularly those which separated the mind into parts such as [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s distinction
between conscious and
[[unconscious]] and those
which separated subjects from objects. Merleau-Ponty thought rather in
terms of continuums of existence, hence his concepts of flesh (*chair*)
and chiasm, which try to explain the interlocking of the differentiated
but not isolated components of existence. In this latter respect he was
clearly influenced by [[Bergson, Henri]]. Merleau-Ponty
died suddenly and unexpectedly and left behind a large corpus of
unfinished material. Thanks to the efforts of diligent editors, two
unfinished books, *Le Visible et l'invisible* (1964), translated as *The Visible and the Invisible* (1968) and *La Prose du monde* (1969),
translated as *The Prose of the World* (1973), have since been
published, as have a selection of his lectures from the Collège de
France.
