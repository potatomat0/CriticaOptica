[[unconscious]]

 An adjective
for thought processes not present---or not visible---in the field of
consciousness at a given moment in time. When [[Freud, Sigmund]] adopted the term, at
a very early stage in his development of
[[psychoanalysis]], he
transformed it from an adjective into a noun designating one of the
three operative systems in the psychical apparatus (the other two being
the preconscious and the conscious), as he refers to it in *Die Traumdeutung* (1900), translated as *The Interpretation of Dreams*
(1953). As Freud conceives it, the unconscious is both a dynamic and a
[[topography]] system: it is
dynamic in the sense that the
[[liminality]] energy and
[[cathexis]] that are active
within it are ceaseless---they apply a constant pressure on the
preconscious and the conscious and are met in turn by an equally
constant pressure
([[repression]]); it is
topographical in that its processes and contents are only accessible to
the conscious mind under very specific conditions, as though there were
some kind of wall separating the different regions of the psychical
apparatus.
In his later years, Freud would modify his view slightly, but he
basically held fast to the idea that the three different parts of the
psychical apparatus are topographically distinct from one another and
that contents of one region cannot pass directly into the next, but must
undergo some kind of distortion or transformation as he details in his
account of the [[dreamwork]].
Dreams, Freud famously said, are the royal road to the unconscious
because they reveal its primary processes:
[[condensation]],
[[displacement]], and
symbolization (a general term referring to the fact that the unconscious
is the place where the
[[instinct]] are given
representational form). As a system, the unconscious is characterized by
four main features: (i) the presence of these primary processes, and the
corresponding flexibility and mobility of
[[desire]] that goes with
them; (ii) the absence of any kind of negation (there is no 'no' in the
unconscious, according to Freud); (iii) an indifference to reality
(anything and everything is possible in the unconscious); and (iv)
subordination to the [[pleasure principle]]. In the 1950s, at
the height of
[[structuralism]], one of
Freud's most important interpreters, the French psychoanalyst [[Lacan, Jacques]], developed the
thesis that the unconscious is structured like a language. His rationale
for this is the fact that, as Freud defines it, we can only grasp the
processes of the unconscious when they take a linguistic form, but for
them to be able to do this the unconscious has to already be structured
like a language. Lacan also described the unconscious as the
[[discourse]] of the
[[Other]], by which is meant
the discourse of radical
[[alterity]]---it is that
which we cannot witness in full and that which transforms us insofar as
we come into contact with it. Lacan's account of the unconscious has
been criticized for being overly linguistic, particularly by [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]] who argue that
the unconscious is better understood as a factory or machine.
