[[utopia]]

 The title of a book
written in 1516 by Sir Thomas More, who was beheaded by King Henry VIII
for his refusal to sign the Act of Supremacy. Derived from the Greek for
'good place', More's *Utopia* imagines an island cut off from the rest
of the world, in which a quite different set of customs and laws than
those of his own day are devised. Over time, utopia became a kind of
code word for any attempt to deliberately construct a world that was
better than the existing world out of which it was produced. It also
tended to be overcoded as idealist, impossible, and unrealistic, making
utopia into a pejorative, at least in political discourse. But this
misconstrues More's purpose and misunderstands what utopia is: it is not
the end result, the perfect place, that is crucial, but rather the
process of imagining what it would take to make the present world
different than it is. Utopia resides not in the ideal dream of global
equality, for example, but in the practical problems associated with
achieving that dream. Utopia means being prepared to alter the status
quo and refusing to accept the dogma that 'there is no alternative'.
