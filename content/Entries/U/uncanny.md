[[uncanny]] 

(*unheimlich*)

 That
which is unfamiliar---or more literally, un-homely---in the familiar or
homely. In a famous essay, 'Das Unheimliche' (1919),
[[Freud, Anna]] argued that the
uncanny is the feeling we get when an experience that occurred by chance
suddenly feels fateful and inescapable. His own quite humorous example
of this is an anecdote about an afternoon walk he took in a small
provincial Italian town in which he happened upon the brothel district
and though he hurriedly exited the area the continuation of his walk
somehow brought him back there, twice, a discomforting fact that he felt
was noticed by the locals. He traces the uncanny feeling this provokes
in him back to infantile psychology because it clearly evidences a
[[compulsion to repeat]] and
argues that anything that reminds us of this aspect of our childhood
will be perceived as uncanny. Literature then is able to create the same
feeling by evoking situations in which a character acts without reason,
or, more particularly, returns when they are thought to be gone---the
archetype of this is the ghost or the zombie. The uncanny is not a new
thing; it is always an old, and usually repressed, thing that recurs in
the place where it is not expected. Russian literary critics [[Todorov, Tzvetan]] uses the concept
of the uncanny in the development of his theory of fantastic literature
in *The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre* (1970).
