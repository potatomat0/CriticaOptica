[[unreliable narrator]]
American literary theorist Wayne Booth's term for a narrator who cannot
be relied on either to tell the truth or in the case of self-reflexive
narrators to know the truth. For example Humbert Humbert, the narrator
of Vladimir Nabokov's *Lolita* (1955), is obviously extremely biased in
his view of things, constantly shifting blame for his actions onto the
teenaged Lolita; but, he also seems to deceive himself as to the true
nature of what he is doing. A major part of the dramatic interest of the
novel stems from the need to try to sort out these two different kinds
of deception. Similarly, narrators can be considered unreliable if they
are found not to be in full possession of all the relevant facts. Henry
James's *The Turn of the Screw* (1898) is a well-known example of this
type.
