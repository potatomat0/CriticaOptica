[[’pataphysics]]
**('*pataphysique*)** French author [[Jarry, Alfred]]'s playful concept
defined in *Gestes et opinions du Docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien*
(1911), translated as *Exploits and Opinions of Dr Faustroll,
Pataphysician* (1965), as the science of imaginary solutions. More than
that, in contrast to so-called general science, it is meant to be a
science of the particular, a science of exceptions, and a science of
alternative or supplementary universes. In 1948 a group of writers,
basically the core of the group that would later call themselves
[[OULIPO]] (Raymond Queneau,
Jean Genet, and Eugene Ionesco, among others), founded a Collège de
'pataphysique and produced a periodical devoted to absurdist writing.
The college and journal folded suddenly and without explanation in 1975.
In an appropriately playful essay included in his final work, *Critique et Clinique* (1993), translated as *Essays Critical and Clinical*
(1997), [[Deleuze, Gilles]]
suggests that Jarry is an unrecognized precursor to
[[Heidegger, Martin]] because they
are both engaged in the task of going beyond metaphysics. In no less
playful fashion, though to perhaps more serious purpose, in *Fatal Strategies* (1983) [[Baudrillard, Jean]] describes
nuclear arms as a 'pataphysical weapons system because it is intended
not to be used, indeed it is intended to eliminate the very need for
weapons. It is perhaps worth adding that Don Delillo's early novel
*Great Jones Street* (1973) contains a hilarious pastiche of this
concept: in a scene about a third of the way into the novel there is a
character who describes himself as a Professor of Latent History whose
work deals with events that almost took place. Jarry is generally
credited as a vital precursor to so-called
[[Absurdism]] writing, while
'pataphysics seems to become prominent anywhere politics starts to seem
absurd.
