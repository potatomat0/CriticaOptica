[[Frank, Manfred]]
 (1945--)


German philosopher and cultural critic. A prolific author of books on
the German Romantic tradition in philosophy (especially the work of
Friedrich Schleiermacher and Johann Gottlieb Fichte), very few of which
have been translated into English, Frank is probably best known though
for his sympathetic critiques of
[[deconstruction]] and
[[post-structuralism]], or
what he himself labels
[[neostructuralism]].
Operating in the hermeneutic tradition of [[Gadamer, Hans-Georg]] and [[Ricœur, Paul]], but radicalizing
their positions significantly, Frank charges [[Barthes, Roland]], [[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Foucault, Michel]], and
[[Lyotard, Jean-François]]
with underplaying the importance of the
[[subject]] and overplaying
the arbitrariness of the
[[sign]]. Frank upholds the
[[structuralism]] position
that the sign is constituted in a systematic network of interconnections
between other signs, but resists the implication that the meaning of
specific signs is completely arbitrary. He insists rather that meaning
is multi-layered and that the network of signs is influenced by history.
But rather than argue, as structuralism does, that it is the system of
signs that confers meaning, Frank takes the contrary view and suggests
that it is the historically sedimented meaning of signs that produce
structures.
