 Welsh cultural critic
[[Williams, Raymond]]'s
concept of how television operates. In a short book entitled
*Television: Technology and Cultural Form* (1974), Williams observes
that television cannot be thought of in terms of single programmes
because the actual experience of watching television is like dining from
a smorgasbord---there is a vast amount of choice. Just as importantly,
television doesn't begin or end with a single programme; there is always
another programme to follow, so its content does not have a defined
shape. Rather it flows like a river. Although he'd been a television
critic for a number of years, writing for the BBC's publication, *The Listener*, Williams didn't develop his theory until he spent a
sabbatical in California. Perhaps it was only when he'd moved away from
the highly structured and regulated television environment of the BBC to
the looser and highly commercialized television environment of
California that he was able to see television for what it really is.
Williams's concept had enormous influence in British [[Cultural Studies]] for a number of
years, but it also had its critics. American critic John Ellis argued
against it in *Visible Fictions* (1982), proposing as an alternative a
theory of television as a segmented commodity.
