[[Freud, Anna]] 
(1895--1982)


Austrian psychoanalyst and youngest daughter of the founder of
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Freud, Sigmund]]. Close to her
father, she recounted her dreams to him from a young age (many of which
are analysed in his book *The Interpretation of Dreams*, which was
published when she was 5 years old), and began reading his work as a
teenager. She underwent analysis with her father as part of the training
to become a psychoanalyst herself in 1918, was admitted to the Vienna
Psychoanalytic Society in 1922, and began taking patients of her own
shortly thereafter. Her research and practice was primarily focused on
children, which made her a rival of [[Klein, Melanie]], with whom she did
not see eye to eye. Indeed, their rivalry briefly threatened to split
the British Psychoanalytic Association, but was in the end resolved
amicably. From 1925 until 1934 she was secretary of the International
Psychoanalytic Association. In 1938, fleeing the Nazis, she moved with
her father, by then very ill with jaw cancer, to London, where she
oversaw the building of his house in Hampstead (in which she lived for
the rest of her life). Posterity, rather unkindly, tends to regard Anna
Freud as having little that was original to say, a perception her
immense labour of editing and translating her father's work did little
to change. And though it is true her own thought is very much an
extension of her father's she nevertheless developed her own take on
things, emphasizing the role of the
[[ego]] (rather than the
[[id]], which was her
father's interest). Her key publication was the *Ego and the Mechanisms
of Defence* (1936).
