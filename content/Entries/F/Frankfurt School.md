[[Frankfurt School]]

 The
collective name for the group of scholars and the body of work
associated directly and indirectly with the Institut für Sozialforschung
(Institute for Social Research), an independent research centre
affiliated with Frankfurt University. In 1937, [[Horkheimer, Max]] defined the
Institute's approach to social and cultural analysis as [[critical theory]], a label that has
become virtually synonymous with the Frankfurt School. Today, for many
people, particularly in Anglo-American [[Cultural Studies]], the Frankfurt
School means a dour, elitist outlook and a hostile attitude to popular
culture. Such gross underestimations of the real achievements of the
school suggest not only ignorance of the work, but also ideological
prejudice. The Frankfurt School regarded capitalist society with
suspicion and was not taken in by its glossier blandishments as some
versions of Cultural Studies have been.
Established in 1923 with the financial backing of Felix Weil, the son of
wealthy grain-merchant Herman Weil, the Institute for Social Research
was intended to be a place for the development of and experimentation
with [[Marxism]] ideas
broadly construed. Private funding gave the Institute the luxury of real
autonomy. It was not obliged to take on students or do any research
except that which coincided with its goals. The first director was Carl
Grünberg, an Austrian, Marxist professor of law and politics, but the
younger members of the Institute found him lacking in imagination, and
it wasn't until the appointment of his replacement [[Horkheimer, Max]] that the
Institute took on the quality we are familiar with today.
Under Grünberg's direction, the Institute maintained close links with
the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow and imported samizdat copies of
unpublished manuscripts by Marx and Engels, which in the political
climate of the times was courageous and provocative. Indicative of this
pro-communist stance, which would be toned down dramatically in later
years, among the Institute's early appointees was Richard Sorge, the spy
who famously told a disbelieving Stalin that Germany was going to invade
the USSR. Other early appointees included Karl Wittfogel, a specialist
in the now mostly discredited notion of the 'Asiatic mode of production'
and a playwright whose works were staged by Piscator and others. The
better known names associated with the Frankfurt School---e.g. [[Adorno, Theodor]], [[Löwenthal, Leo]], [[Fromm, Erich]], and [[Marcuse, Herbert]]---joined the
Institute a few years later. Grünberg suffered a stroke in 1927 from
which he never fully recovered, and stepped down from the role as
director in 1929. His successor was Max Horkheimer and it was under his
direction that the Institute's reputation was made.
Horkheimer brought new fellows to the Institute and with them new ideas
and in this way transformed it into one of the most influential
intellectual movements of the twentieth century. In contrast to his
predecessor, Horkheimer encouraged the questioning of the basic premises
of Marxism and encouraged a philosophical approach to issues of Marxist
doctrine. He also encouraged the use of
[[psychoanalysis]], then
still a relatively new and radical methodology, for the purposes of
social analysis. He also established, under the editorship of [[Löwenthal, Leo]], a sociologist
of literature interested in mass market fiction, the Institute's
journal, *Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung* (Journal for Social
Research). Contributors to the journal included figures like [[Benjamin, Walter]] who was never
part of the school's inner core, but is nevertheless crucial to its
reputation. In the 1930s, Horkheimer mapped out an ambitious programme
of social research inquiring into the nature of political character that
took over a decade to complete.
Watchful of the rise of Nazism in Germany, Horkheimer had the presence
of mind to transfer the Institute to Geneva in 1931 to protect its
largely Jewish membership from the newly implemented race laws. In 1934
the Institute relocated to New York, where it was attached to Columbia
University, and not (as might have been expected given its Marxist
leanings) to the USSR. Using his new position as a base, Horkheimer was
able to employ the Institute's influence and resources to assist a
number of intellectuals in their bid to get visas so as to escape the
Nazis. However, in 1939, following some bad investments, the Institute
found itself in financial difficulty, and was no longer able to fund as
many researchers or projects as it had been accustomed to doing. Some of
its key members, like psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, were obliged to leave
and take work elsewhere, and this caused a great deal of internal
friction and disruption. But the Institute survived and relocated again
in 1941, this time to Los Angeles, were it remained in much looser form
for the duration of the war.
After the war, at the invitation of the West German government (in
recognition of, and as partial compensation for, the injustices of the
Nazi period) the Institute and several of its key members returned to
Frankfurt. It is really only in this period that the label 'Frankfurt
School' actually begins to be used. Horkheimer stepped down as director
of the Institute in favour of Adorno in 1958. Adorno's tenure though
brilliant was marred by his poorly judged decision to call in the police
to restore order following student protests in 1969. He nonetheless drew
some important students to the centre, including future luminaries like
[[Habermas, Jürgen]]. The
Institute continues to do research today, continuing the tradition of
its creators. It is impossible to measure the influence the Frankfurt
School has had on the development of research in the humanities and
social sciences in the past century. But probably its most important
contribution has been its promotion and legitimating of
interdisciplinary research. Recognizing that the split between
disciplines is an artefact of modernity and that in any case no one
discipline is equipped to deal with the complexity of the modern world,
the Frankfurt School happily combined philosophy, psychoanalysis,
Marxist theory, sociology, and economics.
