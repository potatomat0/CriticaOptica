[[free indirect style]]

(*le style indirect libre*)

** A form of writing that enables a narrative told
in the third person to give voice to a first person perspective. In
doing so, it blurs the distinction between narrator and character, thus
allowing the writer to present the character's innermost thoughts and
concerns in an immediate fashion. The most celebrated example of the use
of this mode of writing is Gustave Flaubert's *Madame Bovary* (1857).
