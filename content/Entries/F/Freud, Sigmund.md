[[Freud, Sigmund]]
constructed. It is constituted by the internalization of the
prohibitions and demands parents make on their children and its role is
to emulate them and act as an internal judge and censor the
[[ego]]. The
[[subject]] is not
necessarily conscious of the superego's operation, but its presence is
keenly felt as guilt in pathological cases of mourning and melancholia.
As Freud theorizes it in his second
[[topography]], the superego
is formed via a process of gradual separation from the ego when the
child stops trying to satisfy their
[[field]] desires and
transforms his or her
[[cathexis]] with them into
an identification. In contrast, [[Klein, Melanie]] holds that the
superego is present from the earliest stages and forms as a result of
the [[introjection]] of good
and bad [[object]].
