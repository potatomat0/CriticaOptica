[[futurology]]

 The study of the
possible (and assumed to be likely) nature of the world in the near
future based on what is known about present trends in demography,
technology, and economic geography. Undoubtedly the best-known example
of futurology is Alvin Toffler's 1970 bestseller, *Future Shock*, which
predicted (with some degree of accuracy) the digital revolution that
occurred in the early 1990s. But it also worried that people were not
ready for the changes to come. Government and business are the two
stakeholder groups with the most interest in futurology. Interestingly,
[[Certeau, Michel de]]'s work
on [[everyday life]] was
funded by the French government on the understanding that it would deal
with futurology, but Certeau's research team did not get around to
writing that particular volume (in part because Certeau left France for
a job in California, but also because neither he nor his fellow
researchers were sure they knew what the concept actually meant)---but
there are traces of it in the first volume of his work on everyday life.
