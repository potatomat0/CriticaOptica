[[Frege, Gottlob]] 
(1848--1925)


German philosopher, mathematician, and logician whose work had a strong
influence on twentieth-century linguistics and language philosophy. Born
in Wismar in Pomerania, Frege studied at Jena and Göttingen. He worked
for most of his life in the mathematics department at Jena. He never
published a monograph on philosophy in his own lifetime and it was only
thanks to influential admirers like Bertrand Russell, Rudolf Carnap, and
[[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]] that
his philosophical work became widely known. His first major work was
*Begriffsschrift* (1879), translated as *Conceptual Notation and other
Writings* (1972), which set out to create a formal notational system for
logic. In spite of a very poor initial reception (it was dismissed by
the leading figures of the time), it has nonetheless had a tremendous
influence on the development of the field of mathematical logic ever
since. His real masterpiece, though, came a few years later: *Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik: eine logische mathematische Untersuchung über
der Begriff der Zahl* (1884), translated as *The Foundations of
Arithmetic: A Logico-Mathematical Enquiry into the Concept of Number*
(1968). This was met with a similarly hostile response. Frege then
turned to problems in the philosophy of language and it was this work
which led to him becoming known in [[critical theory]]. In particular, it is
the distinction between *Sinn* (sense) and *Bedeutung* (reference)
outlined in the paper 'Über Sinn und Bedeutung' (1892), translated as
'On Sense and Reference' (1969), that has proved the most consequential
for the development of [[analytic philosophy]]. Frege noted that
two expressions might have the same point of reference (*Bedeutung*);
his famous example is that of the morning star and the evening star,
inasmuch that the morning star and the evening star are in fact one and
the same thing, namely the planet Venus, but have a very different sense
(*Sinn*) according to the different expressions. Frege was directly
influential on [[Husserl, Edmund]], who as a young
scholar wrote a critique of Frege only to be roundly chastised by him in
return. In so doing, however, Frege directed him away from the
psychologism of Brentano and put him on the road to creating his concept
of [[phenomenology]].
