[[Fromm, Erich]] 
(1900--80)


German [[psychoanalysis]] and
critical theorist. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] for many years, but
in later life forged his own path. Fromm completed his undergraduate and
postgraduate training at the University of Heidelberg, where
philosopher-psychiatrist [[Jaspers, Karl]] taught. He
graduated with a PhD in 1922 and then began his training as a clinical
psychoanalyst, starting his own practice in 1927. In 1930 he joined the
Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt and when the Nazis came to
power he moved with the Institute to Geneva and then to Columbia
University in New York. He obtained a teaching position at Bennington
College in 1941 and remained there for the duration of World War II all
the while continuing his private practice as a psychotherapist. In 1950
he moved to Mexico City taking a job at the national university there,
where he worked until his retirement in 1965. Fromm's work pioneered the
social psychological application of psychoanalysis and his writing
reached a mass audience with its key message that the psyche constantly
adapts to meet the challenges of its environment. The key psychological
challenge, as he saw it, was the need to resist the urge to subordinate
oneself to authority and thus deny oneself the burden of freedom. A
prolific author, Fromm's best known books are: *Escape from Freedom*
(1941), *Man for Himself* (1947), *The Art of Loving* (1956), and *To Have or To Be?* (1976).
