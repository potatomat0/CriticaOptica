[[fabula]] 
and *sjužet*
(story and plot). A distinction drawn by [[Russian Formalism]] between the story
told (*fabula*) and the imaginative way in which that story is actually
narrated (*sjužet*). As Victor Erlich observes in his definitive account
of the movement, *Russian Formalism* (1955), the basic story of
Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina* (1869) is fairly meagre---reduced to its
barebones it is a melodramatic account of a young woman who falls in
love with an unworthy man and is driven to suicide---but that gives no
indication of the richness of the telling of the story, which in the
view of many (not least the author himself) places the novel high up in
the pantheon of all-time greats. The distinction is especially useful
for thinking about crime fiction, which relies for its effect on the
disjunction between the events as they must have happened (*fabula*) and
the order in which they are discovered or narrated (*sjužet*). The
Russian Formalists tended to regard such disjunctions as a measure of a
particular work's literariness
([[literaturnost]]). *See also* [[defamiliarization]].
