[[femininity]]

 The culturally
relative ideal [[gender]]
[[identity]] for women.
Varying substantially from one historical period to the next and from
one geographic region to another, femininity is considered by
[[feminism]] to be an imposed
system of rules governing how women should act, look, feel, and even
think within a particular society. Femininity is generally portrayed as
the weaker, lesser [[Other]]
of [[masculinity]]; a fact
that clearly underpins the
[[psychoanalysis]] concept of
penis envy, which supposes that all young girls actually want to be boys
on some level. So internalized are these rules and cultural assumptions
supposed to be, they define not merely how a woman should comport
herself, but what it actually means to be a woman. This can readily be
seen by doing a book search using 'femininity' as a keyword---the
plethora of titles this throws up, from works in philosophy and critical
theory to self-help manuals (both of the psychological and beauty tips
variety) and autobiographies, is astonishing. A similar search for
masculinity yields only a fraction of the results and nothing like the
variety. That femininity is a constrictive demand placed on women by
society has been recognized by female writers throughout the ages, but
it was [[Beauvoir, Simone de]]
who first theorized it. Her argument was that by consenting to play the
roles femininity demands, women effectively consent to their own
oppression. Recent work on femininity has been powerfully influenced by
[[Butler, Judith]],
particularly her concept of performativity (which she derives from [J.
L.  *Austin](#Xeb591892cb62f427d978c9492b437ce8b6ff52e)'s linguistic
concept of the
[[performative]]), by means
of which she argues that gender roles are paradoxical inasmuch that they
aren't fixed and can be varied---women can dress and act like men if
they want to and vice versa---but one cannot choose not to have a
gendered identity.
