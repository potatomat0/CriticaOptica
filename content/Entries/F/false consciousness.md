[[false consciousness]]

 A
[[Marxism]] concept
describing the masking effect of
[[ideology]], which cloaks
the true conditions of things, thus inhibiting the mobilization of
political activism. Thomas Frank's bestselling *What's the Matter of
Kansas* (2004) offered a convincing portrait of what false consciousness
looks like in contemporary society by documenting the fact that voters
in Kansas in the first part of the twenty-first century seemed unaware
that voting Republican meant they were effectively voting against their
own interests. By prioritizing cultural issues, and neglecting labour
and industrial issues, voters demonstrated that they were not conscious
of what is politically significant. Obviously, from a Marxist
perspective, the economic considerations are always given primacy. But
one might just as well argue that the cultural issues are primary.
Marxist tradition, dating back to
[[Marxism]] himself, holds the
rather [[utopia]] view that
false consciousness can be shattered by knowledge, but later critics
like [[Žižek, Slavoj]], who
aligns false consciousness with
[[fantasy]], argue that
people resist taking on board the implications of knowledge. This
position, of knowing the truth of one's situation, but not acting as
though it were true, is known as [[cynical reason]].
