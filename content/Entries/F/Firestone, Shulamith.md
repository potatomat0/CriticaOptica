[[Firestone, Shulamith]]
(1945--2012) Canadian-born
[[feminism]] scholar,
activist, and writer. A central figure in the establishment of
[[radical feminism]], her
best known work *The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution*
(1970) remains a crucial milestone in the field of
[[gender]] studies.
Firestone's thesis was that the political inequality of women originates
with their reproductive capacity, which forces them into a state of
dependency on men (which in turn strengthens the power of the
[[patriarchy]] by making a
political choice appear a political necessity). Her political programme
was built around the need for women to alter their circumstances by
seizing control of the means of reproduction. At the extreme, she
advocated non-human means of reproduction through the use of
sophisticated biotechnology. Her work is cited as an influence by Riot
Grrrl Kathleen Hanna and SF novelist Marge Piercy. It has been
criticized for its [[biological determinism]] and failure to
take into account other social factors such as
[[class]] and
[[race]]. Firestone was a
vanguard author in the [[Second Wave feminism]].
