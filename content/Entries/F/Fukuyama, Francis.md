[[Fukuyama, Francis]]
 (1952--)


American political philosopher. He was born in Chicago, to a
well-educated middle-class family. Fukuyama's father was a second
generation Japanese-American with a doctorate in sociology (as well as
religious training) and his mother a Japanese-born daughter of the
founder of the economics department at Kyoto University. He obtained his
BA at Cornell University, where he studied classics and political
philosophy. There he met one of his key influences, the conservative
cultural critic [[Bloom, Allan]], author of the
bestselling polemical account of the decline of American culture *The Closing of the American Mind* (1987). He then went on to complete a
doctorate at Harvard with Samuel P. Huntington, author of the highly
influential [[neo-racism]]
tract *The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order*
(1998). His career has been divided between positions at the RAND
Corporation and the US State Department, where he specialized in policy
and planning relating to the former Soviet Union and the Middle East,
and prestigious American universities such as George Mason and Johns
Hopkins. Fukuyama shot to prominence with a short essay published in the
right-wing journal, *The National Interest* entitled 'The End of
History?' (1989). Written on the eve of the collapse of so-called
'actually existing socialism' with the fall of the Berlin Wall in
November 1989, Fukuyama's essay seemed to capture the spirit of what
took place: it was not merely the triumph of the capitalist West, it was
also final confirmation of the universal legitimacy of
liberal-democratic order. History had come to an end, Fukuyama claimed,
because (following a highly
[[langue]] line of
thinking) the pinnacle of possible social formations had been attained.
Fukuyama converted this essay into a bestselling book entitled *The End
of History and the Last Man* (1992), sparking an intense debate that
included sophisticated repudiations from several critical theory
luminaries, such as [[Derrida, Jacques]] in *Spectres de
Marx* (1993) translated as *Spectres of Marx* (1994), [Fredric *
Jameson](#Xa05a7d7d5cb63acf6cc36b12115513d76f52f95) in *The Cultural
Turn* (1998), and [[Anderson, Perry]], in *A Zone of
Engagement* (1992). His work since, which has focused on such issues as
trust, the inhuman, and governance, has not attracted the same level of
critical interest (although it continues to sell well), perhaps because
it has not entertained the same philosophically grandiose pretensions as
his debut work.
