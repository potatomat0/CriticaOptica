[[Fish, Stanley]]
 (1938--)


American literary theorist and cultural critic. Born in Providence,
Rhode Island, Fish studied at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale.
He has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, Johns Hopkins
and Duke Universities, the University of Illinois, and Florida
International University. Fish began his career as a Milton scholar and
has written a number of highly regarded books on that subject. In
critical theory he is best known for the concept of the [[interpretive community]], which displaces
the problem of how meaning is produced onto society itself and makes
meaning the practical production of readers rather than texts. Fish is a
high-profile cultural commentator who writes columns for *The New York
Times* and *The Wall Street Journal*, generally taking a
counter-intuitive view of things. For instance, he has famously argued
that the humanities have no use and that is a good thing, and that
political correctness is a waste of time.
[[flâneur]] A psycho-social
type emblematic of
[[modernity]]. The
essentially untranslatable term was introduced into the critical theory
vocabulary by German cultural critic [[Benjamin, Walter]] in his
uncompleted posthumously published *Das Passagen-Werk* (1982),
translated as *The Arcades Project* (1999). Adapting the term
'*flâneur*' from the work of French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire,
especially his essay '*Peintre de la vie moderne*' (1863), translated as
'The Painter of Modern Life' (1964), Benjamin uses it to theorize the
emergence of what would later be called [[consumer society]], i.e. a society in
which practices of consumption rather than production are predominant.
Belonging neither to the poorest class nor the wealthiest class, the
*flâneur* existed on the margin of both the city and the bourgeoisie,
consuming images of both as a spectacle or
[[phantasmagoria]].
[[Cultural Studies]] uses the
concept of the *flâneur* to theorize the experience of consuming the
built environment for itself, particularly the space of shopping malls.
The most influential work on the *flâneur* is still Benjamin's
posthumously published *Charles Baudelaire, Ein Lyriker im Zeitalter des
Hochkapitalismus* (1969), translated as *Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric
Poet in the Era of High Capitalism* (1973). But important and more
contemporary adaptations are also to be found in John Fiske's *Popular Culture and Everyday Life* (1988) and Anne Friedberg's *Window Shopping*
(1985). *See also* [everyday
