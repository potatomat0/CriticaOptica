[[feminist theory]]

 The
extension of [[feminism]]
(understood as a practical social movement concerned to address the
inequality of the sexes) into theoretical discourse. Undoubtedly one of
the most important and influential intellectual currents of the
twentieth century (every bit the equal of
[[Marxism]] and
[[psychoanalysis]]), Feminist
theory encompasses most disciplines from art and architecture through to
science and technology, but it is predominantly concentrated in the
social sciences and the humanities. As diverse as it is, and the
varieties of feminist theory are almost without limit, at its core it
has four principal concerns, which are to: (i) elucidate the origins and
causes of [[gender]]
inequality; (ii) explain the operation and persistence of this state of
affairs; (iii) delineate effective strategies to either bring about full
equality between the sexes or at least ameliorate the effects of ongoing
inequality; and (iv) imagine a world in which sexual inequality no
longer exists. Of the four, feminist theory has tended to prioritize the
first two, leaving the strategic questions to women working in the
field, so to speak, in the various advocacy groups like the National
Organization for Women founded in the US in 1966; while the task of
imagining the future has been parcelled out to creative writers,
particularly those working in SF like Ursula LeGuin and Marge Piercy.
The decision to prioritize one or other of these four problematics is
what gives shape to the specific feminisms.
The causes of sexual inequality are almost impossible to trace since for
all of recorded history it was already an established fact. Therefore it
is ultimately a matter for pure speculation. The most widely accepted
hypothesis is that in prehistoric times biology placed women in a
subordinate position to men because pregnancy and childrearing render
them vulnerable and in need of assistance both to obtain food and fend
off predators. While there is probably some truth to this strand of the
[[biological determinism]]
hypothesis from an anthropological point of view, the practical need to
protect women does not explain the widespread denigration of women and
their socialization as lesser beings. By the same token, as societies
became more prosperous and their technology more sophisticated, women's
vulnerability diminished, but, if anything, the positioning of them as
subordinate seemed to harden. For obvious reasons, then, the issue that
has exercised feminist theorists the most is the one of persistence: why
does [[sexism]] continue
after the principal justification for it has long since ceased to
obtain?
There are three basic answers to this question: first, biology continues
to be a determining factor; second, that it is in men's interest to
maintain the subordination of women; and third, women have been
complicit with their own oppression. Surprisingly, perhaps, [[radical feminism]] like [[Firestone, Shulamith]] supported the
first answer, although she then used it as a stage to call for the use
of biotechnology to put an end to women's reproductive role. Not
surprisingly, the second answer has very widespread support, and shows
the influence of Marxism. In effect, it equates feminist struggle with
[[class struggle]]. The third
answer, which is perhaps the most painful inasmuch as it is a form of
self-criticism, has given rise to the most debate, and perhaps for that
reason has contributed the most in the way of ideas for achieving the
strategic goal of equality between the sexes. Both [[relativism]] and [[Second Wave feminism]] agree that
[[femininity]]---understood
as a male-imposed ideal of how women should look and act---is a major
limiting factor for feminist politics. So from Mary Wollstonecraft to
[[Greer, Germaine]] and [[Millett, Kate]] feminist writers
have advocated to a greater or lesser degree the abandoning of the
practice of self-denial most versions of femininity demand.
Interestingly, some [[Third Wave feminism]] have argued
against this, calling instead for a celebration of femininity.
Setting aside an imposed
[[identity]] is of course
liberating, but it also creates an identity crisis. [[Beauvoir, Simone de]], one of the most
important feminist writers of the twentieth century, famously declared
that woman is made not born, thereby making identity a key agenda item
for feminist research, particularly amongst the so-called French
feminists---[[Cixous, Hélène]], Catherine Clément,
[[Irigaray, Luce]], [[Kristeva, Julia]], and [[Le Dœuff, Michèle]]---who draw on a
wide variety of philosophical sources, but focus particularly on
[[psychoanalysis]], to try to
elucidate what 'woman' means in our time. The answers to this question
are not unproblematic and within the field there has been considerable
debate as to how to handle the material differences between women (e.g.
differences of [[class]],
[[race]], ethnicity,
religion, and sexuality). This debate has progressively refined a
feminist standpoint from which to view and evaluate the world, which has
in turn enabled the development of
[[ecofeminism]] and feminist
ethics as well as feminist film criticism and literary criticism. In
this way feminist theory does not so much imagine an alternative future
as carve out a new way of thinking and acting in the present.
