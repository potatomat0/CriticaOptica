[[Futurism]]

 Artistic movement
originating in Italy in the early 1900s. An
[[avant-garde]] movement led
by the poet [[Metz, Christian]], Futurism
rejected artistic and cultural tradition in favour of a technologically
oriented future. It celebrated war as a liberating force, freeing the
present of the weight of the past, and admired speed, machines, youth,
and violence. There also existed a Russian form of Futurism, which
shared the same values, but was rapidly subsumed by
[[constructivism]].
