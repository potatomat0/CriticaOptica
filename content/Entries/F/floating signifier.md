[[floating signifier]]

 A
signifier without a specific signified (*see*
[[sign]]). Also known as an
'empty signifier', it is a signifier that absorbs rather than emits
meaning. For example, [[Jameson, Fredric]] suggests that the
shark in the *Jaws* series of films is an empty signifier because it is
susceptible to multiple and even contradictory interpretations,
suggesting that it does not have a specific meaning itself, but
functions primarily as a vehicle for absorbing meanings that viewers
want to impose upon it.
