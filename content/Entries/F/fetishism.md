[[fetishism]]

 A psychological
process in which an apparently non-sexual thing (animate or inanimate)
is given the value of a sexual
[[object]]. For example, the
proverbial shoe fetishist finds the sight of shoes arousing. On
[[Freud, Anna]]'s reading, the
fetishist starts by desiring to look at the sexual parts of the body
(e.g. face, breasts, and genitals), but out of fear and shame does not,
and looks away; however, by looking away consistently, the thing they
look away at, such as another person's feet, rather than their face, is
able to remind them of the thing they actually wanted to see. The
process is complete when the alternate object becomes the actual object
of desire. *See also* [commodity
fetishism](#X307ad3b9289bba37c1de4c51e2d73beac76e8fe).
