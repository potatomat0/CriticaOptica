[[First Wave feminism]]

 The
work of the first
[[feminism]] activists in the
early 1800s up to and including the Suffragists (as retrospectively
designated by the [*Second Wave
feminists](#X8ef6b29588803166729e41500692bf29e74e28c)). These feminists
laid the groundwork for future feminists by fighting for the conditions
that enabled them to go to university, vote, and have economic
independence. The First Wave feminists campaigned for both equal rights
in terms of laws and regulations, but also equal cultural rights, so as
to give women the opportunity to pursue whatever career or life choice
they decided on.
