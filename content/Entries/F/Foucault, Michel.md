[[Foucault, Michel]] 
(1926--84)


French philosopher, social historian, political activist and in later
life [[Queer Theory]] icon.
Associated with both the
[[structuralism]] and
[[post-structuralism]]
movements, he never really identified with either, preferring to
describe himself as either an
[[heteroglossia]] or a
[[genealogy]]. At his death
he was one of the most influential intellectuals in the world, his work
studied in practically every branch of the humanities and social
sciences. He died of AIDS at the age 57, cutting short an immensely
productive career.
The son of wealthy, upper-middle-class parents, Foucault was born in
Poitiers, a small provincial city of approximately 40,000 people in
west-central France. His father was a surgeon, and his mother was the
daughter of a surgeon, and it was expected in due course that he too
would take up medicine. An excellent student, in 1946 he gained entry
into the prestigious Parisian institution, the
École Normale
Supérieure ([[ANT]]) on the rue
d'Ulm, where he studied philosophy. His contemporaries at ENS included
such future luminaries as [[Althusser, Louis]] (who was briefly
his tutor) and Jean Laplanche. Like most of his generation, Foucault's
intellectual horizon was dominated by what Vincent Descombes terms the
'three Hs', namely [[genre]],
[[neurosis]], and
[[Heidegger, Martin]]. Indicatively,
he wrote his undergraduate dissertation on Hegel. He joined the
Communist Party in 1950, but had little involvement with their
activities and resigned his membership in 1952 in the wake of the
'doctors' plot'.
Foucault graduated from the ENS in 1951. Thanks to the intervention of
his father he was able to evade military service and continue his
studies. He was granted a three-year scholarship by the Fondation Thiers
to complete a doctorate, but he relinquished it after only one year in
favour of a teaching assistant position in the northern university of
Lille. His first book, *Maladie mentale et personalité* (1954), which he
would later disavow for being too psychological, displayed what would
prove to be a lifelong interest in the distinction between the normal
and the abnormal. A revised version was published in 1962 under the new
title *Maladie mentale et psychologie*, translated as *Mental Illness
and Psychology* (1976), but Foucault disowned this as well. Foucault
considered studying medicine at this point in order to pursue his
interest in psychiatry further, but chance played a part and in 1955 at
the behest of the great mythologist Georges Dumézil Foucault took a
position teaching French at the University of Uppsala in Sweden.
It was here in Uppsala's vast Bibliotheca Walleriana that he began the
monumental work that would eventually become his PhD, *Folie et
déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique* (1961), translated in
abridged form as *Madness and Civilization* (1965) and in complete form
as *History of Madness* (2006). Presented as an archaeology of the
silence of madness, the final manuscript ran to more than 943 pages,
with a further forty pages of notes on top, and brought to bear an
incredible range of material, scientific, medical, artistic, and the
sheerly arcane, the accuracy and interpretation of which has not gone
unchallenged. Indeed Foucault has been accused of gross exaggeration and
outright error, particularly with respect to his reading of the
*Narrenschiff* or 'ship of fools'. The most telling attack, though, came
from his own former pupil [[Derrida, Jacques]], who gave a
devastating critique of *Folie et déraison* in a lecture Foucault
himself attended in 1963 (it has since been republished in his
*L'Écriture et la différence* (1967), translated as *Writing and
Difference* (1978).
Foucault moved twice more before his thesis was finished---firstly to
Poland for a brief stint heading up the Centre Français at the
University of Warsaw, occasionally doubling as cultural attaché as well;
then to Hamburg, and the Institut Français, where he completed the
compulsory complementary thesis, an introduction to and translation of
Immanuel Kant's comparatively minor work, *Anthropologie in
pragmatischer Hinsicht* (1798) (Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of
View). In 1960 Foucault returned to France to take up a position
teaching psychology at Clermont-Ferrand, six hours by train from Paris
where he continued to live throughout the six years of his appointment
there. Foucault's next two books appeared simultaneously in 1963:
*Naissance de la clinique*, translated as *The Birth of the Clinic*
(1973) and *Raymond Roussel*, translated as *Death and the Labyrinth*
(1986). The former brought the archaeologist's eye to the work of the
medical gaze itself, inquiring into the way in which it developed, while
the latter extended his interest in the work of *déraison* or
'unreason'.
Foucault's career was until 1966 solid, respectable and respected but
confined exclusively to the halls of academia. This changed, much to his
own surprise, with the publication of *Les Mots et les choses* (1966),
translated as *The Order of Things* (1970). Despite being every bit as
recondite and dense as his previous books, it was the breakout
bestseller of 1966, its original print run of 3,000 selling out in a
week. His audience now greatly enlarged, Foucault was henceforth able to
assume a role similar to that of [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] as a public
intellectual. It is notoriously difficult to pin down why a particular
book should succeed, but it is generally thought that it was its
apocalyptic ending, effectively pronouncing the death of man, that
somehow caught the mood of the times. Academically, though, it was the
book's dramatic opening which drew stark attention to the peculiarity of
thought and asked how and why it is possible to think certain things in
one historical period and not another. In doing so, it introduced
several new terms which would become Foucault's stock-in-trade and
influence the human and social sciences for decades, especially
[[archive]],
[[discourse]], and
[[episteme]]. These rather
mysterious terms were rendered rather more concrete with the publication
of *L'Archéologie du savoir* (1969), translated as *The Archaeology of
Knowledge* (1972), which in many ways reads as kind of user's guide to
*Les Mots et les choses*.
In spite of, or perhaps because of, his newfound fame, Foucault chose to
move to Tunis in 1966. However, he was obliged to leave Tunisia after
only two years because of his involvement with pro-Palestinian students.
He was in Tunis when the events of [[May ’68]] erupted in Paris, and
visited the city soon after. But because of what he had seen in Tunisia
he always felt the students in Paris had it much easier than their
colleagues on the other side of the Mediterranean. It was in Tunis that
Foucault wrote *L'Archéologie du savoir*, his only purely methodological
work. In part it is written as a defence against criticisms his previous
work had received, but it was also an attempt to systematize his thought
and set his conceptual house in order. It didn't have the sales success
of its predecessor, but it soon became---in spite of its author's
intentions---something of a structuralist's handbook.
On his return from Tunis in October 1968, Foucault was offered the
foundation chair of philosophy at the newly created 'experimental'
university of Vincennes. He used his position to create a stellar
department. His appointments included [[Badiou, Alain]], [[Balibar, Étienne]], François
Châtelet, [[Deleuze, Gilles]],
Jacques-Alain Miller ([[Lacan, Jacques]]'s son-in-law and
anointed successor), and [[Serres, Michel]], to name only some.
His tenure at Vincennes again proved to be brief. In 1970 at the age of
only 42, Foucault was appointed to the Collège de France, the most
prestigious research institution in the country, where he remained until
his death fourteen years later. Interestingly, Foucault didn't publish a
single-authored book again until 1975. His first years at the Collège
were spent on collaborative projects---in conjunction with his students
he published a dossier with notes on the infamous case of Pierre
Rivière, who murdered his mother, sister, and brother in 1835; outside
academia he formed the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (Group for
Information on Prisons) which sought to expose conditions in French
prisons by interviewing prisoners, ex-prisoners, social workers, and
guards and compiling the information.
These two strands were woven together with Foucault's next book,
*Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la Prison* (1975), translated as
*Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison* (1977). As with his
previous books on the asylum and the clinic, *Surveiller et punir*
pursues two lines of historical inquiry: on the one hand it tries to
identify the historical conditions necessary for this particular type of
institution to come into being, while on the other hand it inquires
after the changes in thought itself that were required to have conceived
of such an institution in the first place. Many readers have found this
book to be incredibly gloomy because of the way Foucault charts the
spread of the idea of incarceration and its mechanisms of
surveillance---the
[[panopticon]]---into the
reality of everyday life, arguing that schools, factories, offices, and
shops are all organized along the same lines. With Foucault's
characteristic flair for the astonishing example, *Surveiller et punir*
combined case material with theoretical speculation to argue that power
and knowledge are synonymous. This work was championed by the *nouveaux philosophes* ([[New Philosophers]]), a tribute
about which Foucault remained ambivalent.
Foucault now turned his eye towards the self. In 1976 he published the
first of what was projected to be a six-volume history of
[[sex]] and
[[sexuality]], *La Volonté de
savoir*, translated as *The History of Sexuality: An Introduction*
(1978). Following the publication of this book it is thought by some
(especially Dreyfus and Rabinow) that Foucault underwent some kind of
personal or at least intellectual crisis and that the work that follows
is radically different. This thesis is hotly disputed (by Deleuze, among
others), but supported by the fact that the next two volumes in the
series didn't appear until 1984. In the intervening years Foucault
seemed to undergo a kind of 'conversion' experience and whereas before
he had spoken insistently about the dialectic of power and resistance,
now he began to speak about the possibility of self-fashioning (a term
he adopted from [[Greenblatt, Stephen]]). His political
activity in these years took on a more geopolitical hue---he travelled
to Iran in 1979 to report on the revolution there, and in 1981 and 1982
he publicly supported the Solidarity movement in Poland.
Foucault's next book, *L'Usage des plaisirs* (1984), translated as *The Use of Pleasure* (1985), the last to appear in his lifetime, examines
the ways in which the self is regulated via its
[[pleasure]]. He corrected
the proofs of the third volume of the history of sexuality, *Le Souci de
soi* (1984), translated as *The Care of the Self* (1986), on his
deathbed. A fourth volume on the confessions of the flesh was all but
completed, and it is rumoured that a fifth on pornography had been
drafted, but Foucault's dying decree was that there be no posthumous
publications and so far that has been honoured, with the exception of
his lectures at the Collège de France, six volumes of which (at last
count) have been transcribed and published. Foucault isn't the
fashionable name he once was, but it can safely be said his legacy is
far from exhausted. A considerable corpus of his unpublished works may
be consulted at the Bibliothèque du Saulchoir in Paris.
