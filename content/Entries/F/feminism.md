[[feminism]]

 One of the most
important social movements of the past two centuries and certainly the
social movement which has brought about the most enduring and
progressive transformation of human society on a global scale. It is
customary to divide the history of feminism into a
[[Futurism]],
[[code]], and [[Third Space]], with each period
signalling a different era in the struggle to attain equality between
the sexes. Today feminism means many different things to different
people, but at its core, if one goes back to its origins in the late
eighteenth century, it is primarily a social movement for the
emancipation of women. That movement was slow to start, and it wasn't
until the late 1880s that the term 'feminism' actually appeared. Before
then, the more usual term was 'women's rights'. The first advocates for
women's rights were for the most part lonely voices pleading against
obvious and manifest iniquities in society's treatment of women.
This was certainly the case in one of the earliest self-consciously
feminist works, namely Mary Wollstonecraft's *A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman* (1792), which was written at the height of the French
Revolution. Establishing what would become a common theme throughout
much feminist writing, Wollstonecraft conducts her critique on two
fronts: on the one hand, she criticizes
[[patriarchy]] society (as
it would later be called) for the unjust way it limits women's rights,
as well as their opportunity for education, self-expression, and
economic independence; while on the other hand, she criticizes women for
buying into [[femininity]]
which, in her view, turns women into mere 'spaniels' and 'toys'.
Wollstonecraft's solution was better education for young women, not the
granting of equal rights. So in this sense, one might say feminism
begins not with Wollstonecraft but rather with the various Women's
Suffrage movements that sprang up in the early 1800s.
Achieving full voting rights for all women regardless of age,
[[race]], or marital status
took more than a century of struggle, easily justifying Juliet
Mitchell's claim that feminism is 'the longest revolution'. The focus on
voting rights, as important as these are, tends to obscure the fact that
it was not only the right to vote that women were fighting for, though
this was of course emblematic inasmuch that once they could vote they
would be able to use the democratic process to bring about other forms
of change. In point of fact, however, even after women obtained the
right to vote in most parts of the world at the turn of the twentieth
century, it was still several decades before full equality was obtained.
And many would say that it has not yet been obtained.
It is worth mentioning that throughout the long First Wave of feminism
women fought against several other injustices as well, of which three
are key. (i) Women were restricted in terms of the ownership of
property, requiring them to marry so as to inherit, thus preventing them
from attaining true independence (it is this issue which exercises
proto-feminist writers like Jane Austen and Charlotte BrontÃ«). (ii)
Women did not have full rights over their own body, which meant they had
no legal protection against sexual violence (e.g. the idea that a
husband could rape his wife was not admitted as law until late in the
twentieth century). (iii) Women were discriminated against in the
workplace, which not only meant women were paid less than men for the
same work, it also restricted them from applying for certain jobs,
denied them promotion, and made no allowance for maternity leave. Many
of these problems persist today.
Once suffrage was granted, the women's rights movement fell into
decline, and remained quiescent until the late 1950s and early 1960s
when it was reignited by a new generation of activists who called
themselves the Second Wave of feminism. [[Friedan, Betty]]'s *The Feminine
Mystique* (1963) is generally credited as the tipping point for this
second round of political struggle. Echoing Wollstonecraft, she argued
that women were victims of a false belief in the promise of femininity
and urged them to look beyond their domestic situation for fulfilment.
The National
Organization for Women
([[BWO]]) was formed in 1966
and became the central focus, in the US, for feminist activism. Its goal
was the ratification of an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution,
which it did not manage to achieve in full, but it nonetheless made
giant strides towards it. Second Wave feminism also took the view that
equality between the sexes would only come about if there was a sea
change in cultural attitudes on the part of both women and men. Authors
like [[Greer, Germaine]] and
[[Millett, Kate]] called for a
sexual liberation as well, arguing that women could alter their status
as the second sex (to borrow the title of [[Beauvoir, Simone de]]'s important book)
by overturning the double standards applied to their sexuality and
behaviour.
The Second Wave of feminism came to an end in the early 1980s partly as
a result of its successes---many women felt that all the relevant
battles had been fought and won---but primarily because of the change in
political climate. The Reagan-Thatcher era was very unfriendly to equal
rights and it rolled back many of the gains that had been made. This is
the period of the so-called 'culture wars' when feminism was caricatured
as mere political correctness and its political agenda scorned in the
press. Third Wave feminist scholar Susan Faludi documents this in her
*Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women* (1991). But there were also
problems within feminism. Feminist scholars of colour, particularly
those from the [[Third World]], argued very
forcefully that feminism neglected
[[race]] and
[[class]]. These issues are
central to the Third Wave, which many cite as beginning with the
outraged response of feminist critics to the treatment of Anita Hill
during the Senate-confirmation hearings for US Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas in 1991. Hill testified that Thomas sexually harassed
her when she was working in the Department of Education, and later at
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Thomas flatly denied this,
and was subsequently confirmed by the Senate.
