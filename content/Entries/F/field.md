[[field]]

 The network of social
relations, regulations and adaptive possibilities specific to a social
group, which may be defined in terms of location (such as a town or
village), profession (artists, academics, and so forth), or class (blue
collar, white collar, etc.). Developed by French sociologist [[Bourdieu, Pierre]], the field is an
objectifiable structured space, which means its rules for inclusion and
exclusion, as well as the nature of the strategies one may employ while
operating within its boundaries, can be identified and articulated. As
Bourdieu demonstrates in *Homo Academicus* (1984), translated as *Homo Academicus* (1988) and *Les Règles de l'art* (1992), translated as *The Rules of Art* (1996), it is possible to identify the structure of both
academia and the art world and indeed any other sphere of life. With
respect to art, Bourdieu dismisses the idea of the creative genius
labouring in isolation as an impossibility---the artist, he shows, must
be aware of a field (not just the 'art world' as it is sometimes said,
but the very possibility of art itself looked at from a social
perspective) in order to know what counts as art and to know where its
ontological boundaries are so they can be pushed. It is in the encounter
with this field that the artist is formed. Bourdieu developed this term
in conjunction with
[[habitus]] and
[[practices]].

[[film noir]] A film
movement---or, better yet, film style---that began in the US in the
early 1940s and persisted until the late 1950s. The term was created by
French film critics by analogy with *roman noir*, the French term for
hard-boiled crime novels. Following the end of World War II large
quantities of American films were imported into France, forcing French
critics to take notice of Hollywood productions whereas previously they
had written them off almost as a matter of course. John Huston's 1941
film of Dashiell Hammett's *Maltese Falcon* (1930) is widely considered
the first *film noir*, but Marcel Carné's prior *Le Jour se lève* (1939)
also has a claim on this title. In both cases, there is also an obvious
influence of 1920s German Expression, not the least because many of the
most important *film noir* directors were in fact German émigrés (e.g.
Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg, Billy Wilder, Otto Preminger, Douglas
Sirk, and Max Ophuls). Although it is predominantly associated with
detective thrillers, there are also *film noir* westerns and melodramas,
so it cannot be considered a
[[genre]] in the true sense
of the word. Stylistically, it is typified by three distinctive
characteristics: first, and most prominently, its visual style is
characterized by stark contrasts between light and dark used to
symbolize 'good' and 'evil'; second, its narratives are morally
ambiguous, frequently ending on a bathetic 'winner loses' note; third,
its characters are of a limited variety of stereotypes---the grotesque
villain, the beautiful but flawed *femme fatale*, and the emotionally
damaged hero who seeks for justice in an unjust world, even if he has to
break the law to do it. The best-known example, in this regard, is
undoubtedly Howard Hawks's 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's *The Big Sleep* (1939), starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. *Film noir* has been of particular interest to film critics interested in
[[psychoanalysis]] because
its stories seem to be more about the complexities of human sexuality
than their ultimately mundane crime and punishment plots. Because of the
way the *femme fatale* uses her sexuality and breaks with the Hollywood
convention of depicting women as passive (mother, whore, wife, or
mistress), she has been subject to considerable theoretical attention.
*Film noir* has also drawn the attention of film critics interested in
the relationship between film and architecture because of its intensely
urban character and the way it represents buildings.
