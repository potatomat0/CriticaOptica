[[Frye, Northrop]] 
(1912--91)


Canadian literary critic and theorist renowned for his innovative use of
[[Jung, Carl]]'s theory of
[[archetype]] and
[[myth]]. Born in Sherbrooke,
Quebec, Frye studied English at Victoria College in Toronto. He then
studied theology and completed his orders to become a minister in the
Uniting Church of Canada in 1936. He did pastoral work for a short
period, and then took a scholarship to go to Merton College, Oxford.
After completing his studies at Oxford he returned to a position at
Victoria College, where he remained for the rest of his career,
eventually rising to the rank of Chancellor. He was very much a public
intellectual determined to raise the profile of literary criticism and
demonstrate its importance to non-academic readers. The lectures in *The Educated Imagination* (1963) were originally broadcast on Canadian radio
and from 1968 to 1977 he served as a board member for the Canadian
Radio-Television and Telecommunication Commission, which regulates the
media in Canada.
Frye's first book, a study of the English poet William Blake, *Fearful Symmetry* (1947), brought him immediate international attention because
it offered a powerful counterpoint to the dominant [[New Criticism]], overturning its
textual isolationist policy, but retaining its close reading technique
in modified form. Frye describes the New Critics as being like visitors
to an art gallery who stand so close to the picture all they can see is
the texture of the paint, whereas his preference is to stand so far back
that the content blurs and reveals itself as a pure archetypal outline.
In contrast to the New Critics, Frye read literary texts in relation to
both other literary texts (indeed, for Frye this literally meant all
literary texts---his viewpoint was astoundingly synoptic) and the social
context which yielded them in the first place. Literature has to mean
something to its readers Frye thought, by which he meant it has to serve
a social purpose. Hence his interest in
[[myth]], which for Frye are
complex allegories concerning the relation between humans and their
gods. Frye systematized his thinking on myth in what is by far his best
known work, and indeed for many one of the most important works of
criticism of the twentieth century, *Anatomy of Criticism* (1957).
Myth, for Frye, centres on the mobilization of archetypes (which he
conceives slightly differently from [[Jung, Carl]], though with an
obvious awareness and admiration for him), arguing that it is the
production of archetypes that saves literature from creating mere
stereotypes. Frye uses the notion of displacement (comparable, though
not the same as [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s notion of
[[displacement]]) to account
for the way mythic structures can permeate realist or naturalist texts,
even though the magical elements have been stripped away---James Joyce's
*Ulysses* (1922) is the best-known example of this. Between the extreme
of pure myth and so-called realist texts (a word Frye objected to) lies
romance. Thus, Frye proposes that there are three orders of myth. He
balances his analysis of myth with a study of modes, symbols, and
genres, thus creating one of the greatest literary typologies ever
produced. Some critics have found his ceaseless classification of types
oppressive, while others have seen it as a precursor to
[[structuralism]], and for
both these reasons Frye's work has fallen into a state of relative
neglect. Yet as [[Jameson, Fredric]] shows in *The Political Unconscious* (1981), Frye's typologies can be used to great
effect for contemporary criticism, even if one does not agree fully with
his ontology.
Frye was a prolific author right up until his death. He wrote books on
Canadian literature, T. S. Eliot, Shakespeare, Milton, and the Bible.
