[[Friedan, Betty]] 
(1921--2006)


American feminist, political activist, and co-founder of the
National
Organization for Women
([[BWO]]). Her book, *The Feminine Mystique* (1963), a huge bestseller, is generally credited with
initiating so-called [[Second Wave feminism]]. Friedan's book
spoke of that claustrophobic existence of the suburban 'housewife' and
as later feminist critics would point out she seems to have been
oblivious of [[class]],
[[ethnicity]],
[[race]], and the other
cultural and legal barriers to equality that women face. Nevertheless,
her book was a rallying cry for women to demand the right to define
their own social role. The feminine mystique she spoke of was the social
role constructed for women by men that women have been persuaded or
coerced into accepting, namely that women are caregivers, that they are
nurturers and so on, by reason of biology, and therefore better suited
to jobs in fields like nursing and teaching. She wrote a number of other
works, but none that had the effect of her first book.
