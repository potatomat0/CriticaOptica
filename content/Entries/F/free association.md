[[free association]] 

(*freie Assoziation*)

** A therapeutic technique in
[[psychoanalysis]] developed
by [[Freud, Sigmund]] as a
means of gaining access to the
[[unconscious]] thoughts
underpinning dreams, fantasies, and symptoms. The technique consists in
asking the [[analysand]] to
say whatever comes to mind during the course of analysis without regard
for relevance or fear of embarrassment. Thus, it is free in the sense of
being free from censorship and constraint; its specific purpose is to
eliminate voluntary responses to questions, which by their very nature,
aim to control the flow of information. Freud initially used hypnosis
with his patients in order to try to access unconscious thoughts, but
soon replaced it with free association, which he found much more
effective.
