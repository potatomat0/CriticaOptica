[[fantasy]]

 In
[[psychoanalysis]], fantasy
is the [[imaginary]] staging
of an [[unconscious]]
[[desire]]. [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s rejection of his
own [[seduction theory]]
hinged on his realization of the importance fantasy plays in the psychic
life of the subject. What he realized is that it is enough for a
particular act to be fantasized about for it to be significant to a
particular subject, and that it doesn't have to have actually taken
place. [[Lacan, Jacques]]
makes fantasy the central concept in his account of psychoanalysis, but
gives it another role to play. Whereas Freud saw fantasy as being in
some sense in conflict with reality, for Lacan, fantasy is at once a
defence against reality and a necessary support for reality. This latter
proposition is fundamental to the work of Lacanian psychoanalyst [[Žižek, Slavoj]].
