[[fragmented body]] 

**(*corps morcel√©*)** [[Lacan, Jacques]] 's conceptualization
of the disconnected and unorganized state of the psyche prior to the
[[mirror stage]]. As Lacan
theorizes it, the child under the age of 18 months is unaware that their
body is distinct from their mother's body, and similarly unaware that
their body is a unitary whole. The memory of this feeling of
disassociation remains with the subject throughout their life, buried in
the [[unconscious]], but
constantly threatening to return to the surface and shatter the illusion
of wholeness the subject lives by.
