[[functionalism]]

 A term used
in architecture, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. It
has a slightly different meaning in each context, but in every case it
implies a conscious emphasis on delineating how things function within a
specific field of inquiry. In architecture, which is in many ways
emblematic of the term's meaning across all disciplines, functionalism
refers to a style of building in which design reflects purpose. The
so-called [[international style]] architects were
adherents of this principle. In sociology, linguistics and philosophy,
functionalism refers to the starting premise that all aspects of
society, from language through social rituals such as marriage to
thought itself exist only to serve a particular purpose.
