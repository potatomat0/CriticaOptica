[[foundationalism]]

 The
position in philosophy that all knowledge must be grounded on certain
unassailable facts or truths, usually secured via a combination of
experience and reason. The two most famous examples of this are Ren√©
Descartes's assertion 'I think, therefore I am' and [[Kant, Immanuel]]'s designation of
reason as the ground of philosophy. *See also*
[[anti-foundationalism]].
