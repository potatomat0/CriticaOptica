[[Fanon, Frantz]] 
(1925--61)


Psychiatrist, activist, and revolutionary theorist. Fanon was born on
the Caribbean island of Martinique. He attended the prestigious Lycée
Victor Schoelcher, where one of his teachers was the great poet and
activist [[Césaire, Aimé]],
who would be an influence for the rest of his life (he admired Césaire's
theory of [[négritude]], but
rejected its appeal to racial authenticity). During World War II he
experienced directly the violence he would later become famous for
advocating in his writing. He fought with the Free French Forces in
Europe and was wounded in 1944. After the war he studied medicine and
psychiatry in Lyons, graduating in 1951. His time in the army, then as a
student in Lyons, was formative because it was his first experience of
racism as an endless series of psychologically damaging
micro-aggressions. In an essay written for *Esprit*, published in 1952,
Fanon argued that racial marginalization is a danger to the mental
health of people forced to endure it. Fanon's entire career would be
spent exploring this nexus between politics, psychiatry, and violence.
His first position as a psychiatrist was at a hospital in
Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole, where he had the opportunity to work with
François Tosquelles, one of the founders of institutional psychotherapy
(an important influence for [[Guattari, Félix]]). Tosquelles'
idea was that psychiatric patients were doubly isolated, both clinically
and socially, and therefore the clinic should try to replicate the
routines and patterns of life outside the asylum. Fanon adopted and
elaborated upon these ideas when he moved to French-controlled Algeria
in 1953 to take up the position of *chef de service* at the
Blida-Joinville Psychiatric Hospital. His patients there were a mixture
of European women and Muslim men, living in conditions that he later
described as a mirror of the compartmentalized world of colonialism. He
built a traditional teahouse for his Muslim patients, creating a space
for them to socialize. He brought in Arab musicians and storytellers to
entertain them, much to the distaste of his fellow physicians.
His first book, *Peau noire, masques blancs* (1952), translated as
*Black Skin, White Masks* (1986), was originally intended as his medical
thesis, but it was rejected. Written while he was in France, but also
drawing on his experiences in Martinique where he grew up, and Algeria
where was stationed during the war, it sought to capture and account for
the 'lived experience of a black man'. It is a study of the
psychological damage caused by colonialism and racism combined.
Theoretically it draws on [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]], particularly his
analysis of anti-Semitism, and the
[[psychoanalysis]] of
[[Lacan, Jacques]], in a bid
to analyse what he saw as a debilitating inferiority complex amongst his
black peers. He also recognized that there was a superiority complex at
work in white people that also needed to be addressed if progressive
change was to be made.
Over the next few years he concentrated on the practical matters of
psychiatry, developing therapeutic strategies that [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] would later
acknowledge as a precursor to what they called
[[schizoanalysis]]. Fanon
ceased to focus exclusively on the psychosexual history of the
individual and began to factor in sociocultural concerns. His extensive
writings on this subject have not been fully studied or anthologized.
However, a large selection has recently been made available in a
collection edited by Robert Young and Jean Khalfa entitled *Écrits sur
l'aliénation et la liberté* (2015), translated as *Alienation and
Freedom* (2018).
When the Algerian Revolution erupted in 1954, Fanon got to see at first
hand the effects of colonial violence. He joined the
Front de Libération
Nationale ([[ANT]]) almost
immediately, and used his position to assist the revolution. He was
expelled from Algeria in 1957, after which he move to Tunis, where he
continued his involvement with the FLN.
He joined the editorial collective of the journal *El Moudjahid* and
attended conferences on decolonization throughout Africa and reported on
these for the journal. Some of these pieces are collected in *Pour la
révolution africaine* (1964), translated as *Toward the African
Revolution* (1994). It was in this period, too, that Fanon wrote the
work which made him internationally renowned: *Les Damnés de la terre*
(1961), translated as *The Wretched of the Earth* (1965). This work
became infamous for its discussion of the necessity of violence, not
just to win power, but also to imprint the minds of the revolutionaries
with the significance of their undertaking. Its message reverberated
throughout the [[Third World]], which was then in the
throes of a radical process of
[[decolonization]], but its
legacy is ambivalent. Fanon was aware that violence is not without cost,
and he foresaw a long period of healing being necessary following the
overthrow of colonial regimes. He thought that violence would lead to
solidarity amongst the colonial nations, but in this respect he was
sorely mistaken.
He was diagnosed with leukaemia in his early thirties. At first he
sought treatment in the USSR. When this did not work, he tried his luck
in the US. But it was all to no avail. He died at Bethesda Hospital,
Maryland, at the age of 36. Little known in his own lifetime,
particularly in France, where his books sold hardly at all (not helped
by the fact they were frequently banned for discussing the war in
Algeria, which the French government did not want to admit to or
discuss), Fanon has become a symbol of
[[collocation]] struggle.
His work inspired Che Guevara, Malcolm X, and Steve Biko among many
others.
His life has inspired at least one novel, John Edgar Wideman's *Fanon*
(2008), and at least one film, Isaac Julien's 1996 documentary *Frantz Fanon: Black Skin White Mask*. But by far the most important tribute to
his work is the film *The Battle of Algiers* (1966), directed by Gillo
Pontecorvo, which drew heavily on *Les Damnés de la terre* in filming.
Virtually all the major postcolonial theorists from [[Bhabha, Homi]] to [[Gates, Henry Louis Jr]] pay homage to his
work.
