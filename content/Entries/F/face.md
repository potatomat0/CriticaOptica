[[face]] 
(visage). [[Levinas, Emmanuel]]'s term
for the presence of the
[[Other]]. It is an ambiguous
concept because it simultaneously does and does not refer to actual
human faces. It does refer to human faces inasmuch as the face is the
most expressive part of the human body, but does not refer to actual
human expressions. The face is not an object of experience or perception
for Levinas, it is rather an epiphany or revelation---it transforms us,
but does not yield knowledge. Levinas uses the notion of the face to
think through the problematic of the self's relation with the infinitely
Other. The face is what separates the self from the Other, thus stopping
the Other from annihilating it. By the same token, the face appears in
'my' world, but I cannot harm it. It is not *of* this world.
