[[fundamentalism]]

 A strict
adherence to a religious or political doctrine often coupled with an
extremely dogmatic interpretation of the founding text of that religion
or political position (e.g. Bible, manifesto). Fundamentalism can also
refer to the practice of treating religious works such as the Bible or
Koran as the literal word of God.
