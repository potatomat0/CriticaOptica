[[foreclosure]]
**(*Verwerfung*/*forclusion*)** The psychoanalytic term for the
repudiation of a specific
[[desire]]. It differs from
[[repression]] in that the
incompatible desire is not merely prevented from entering the
consciousness, all trace of its existence is denied, as if the thought
had never arisen. In his reading of
[[Freud, Anna]], [[Lacan, Jacques]] treats foreclosure
as the specific mechanism of psychosis (in contrast to
[[neurosis]]); he argues that
the psychotic [[subject]]
forecloses on the Name-of-the-Father (that which organizes the subject's
symbolic field and gives them their identity and meaning to their
reality). In effect, then, foreclosure is the repudiation of the
organizational structure of reality, hence Lacan's treatment of it as a
flight into psychosis.
[[fort/da]] [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s name for a game
played by his 18-month-old grandson involving a cotton reel which the
boy would repeatedly throw out of his cot, exclaiming 'Oo' as he did so,
forcing his mother to retrieve it for him, at which he would utter an
appreciative 'Ah'. Freud interpreted these noises as babyish
approximations of '*fort*', meaning 'gone', and '*da*', meaning 'there'.
The significance of the game, which Freud discusses in 'Beyond the
Pleasure Principle' (1920), is that it shows the child transforming an
unhappy situation, one in which they have no control over the presence
of their parents, into a happy one in which the parents are at the beck
and call of the child. Freud also interpreted it as a kind of revenge on
the parents, a way of saying to them that they aren't so important. *See also* [[compulsion to repeat]].
