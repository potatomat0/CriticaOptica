[[Hardt, Michael]]
 (1960--)


American [[Marxism]]
philosopher, social theorist, and cultural critic best known for his
collaborative work with Italian Marxist philosopher [[Negri, Antonio]] with whom he has
co-authored four books.
Hardt was born in Rockville, Maryland in the USA, and raised in the
suburbs of Washington DC where his father worked as a Sovietologist
(specializing in economics) at the Library of Congress. He studied
engineering at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania during the prolonged
'energy crisis' of the 1970s. His choice of major was motivated by a
political desire to help develop alternative energy technology for the
poor. He spent his summers in Italy working in a factory making solar
panels. In 1983 he moved to Seattle to do a PhD in Comparative
Literature, again because it seemed to offer the best way forward for
him to advance his political thinking. At this time, too, he was
volunteering for the Christian 'Sanctuary Movement' in Guatemala and El
Salvador, which provided shelter for refugees trying to escape the
CIA-funded wars ravaging those countries. With characteristic modesty,
Hardt would later say his time in South America helped him more than he
was able to help others.
In the summer of 1987, Hardt travelled to Paris to meet with Antonio
Negri to go through some questions he had regarding the English
translation of *L'anomalia selvaggia. Saggio su potere e potenza in
Baruch Spinoza* (1981), translated as *The Savage Anomaly: The Power of
Spinoza's Metaphysics and Politics* (1991). The meeting proved
fortuitous. Negri suggested to Hardt that he move to Paris, which he
did, and invited him to join the editorial board of the journal he was
founding, *Futur Ant√©rieur*. Then when an editor at the University of
Minnesota Press asked Negri to put together a collection of his early
writings for publication, Negri countered by suggesting a collaborative
book written with Michael Hardt dealing with contemporary issues. The
resulting work, combining essays from Negri's previous books *Operati e
Stato* (1972) (Work and State) and *La Forma Stato* (1977) (The Form of
the State) with new essays by both him and Hardt, was the first step
towards the work which would bring them both such international renown.
Hardt's first solo work, *Gilles Deleuze: An Apprenticeship in
Philosophy*, a reworked version of his PhD, was published in 1993. One
of the first full-length monographs published on
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and still one of
the most important, Hardt's book offered an astute reading of Deleuze as
a political philosopher. In 1994, after spending two years at
[[COBRA]]
(University of
California, Los Angeles), Hardt was appointed to the Literature
Programme at Duke University. Over the next several years he worked on
another collaborative project with Negri, which would be published in
2000 as *Empire*. Resonating strongly with the optimistic fervour for
change ignited by the
anti-[[BWO]]
World Trade
Organization) movement that took to the streets in such numbers in
Seattle, Genoa, and elsewhere as the twentieth century drew to a close,
the concept of [[Empire]]
captured the millennial spirit of the moment perfectly and the book
became an instant worldwide bestseller.
*Empire* is only the first instalment of a vast and vastly ambitious
project to rethink the political composition of our time (the second
instalment, *Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire* appeared
in 2005, and the third, *Commonwealth*, in 2009). It argues that the
worldwide processes of economic, political, and social transformation
generally referred to as
[[globalization]] have
created the necessary conditions for the emergence of a new form of
global sovereignty which will rein in the interests of specific
nation-states and give more space to the needs of specific subjects,
regardless of their place in the world. The new people rising up to
assume this new form of sovereignty are referred to as the
[[multitude]] by Hardt and
Negri. By the same token they argue that the old forms of imperial
thinking no longer work as well as they used to. The Empire project is a
controversial one and just as it has many enthusiastic supporters, it
also has a number of stern critics on both the Left and the Right.
