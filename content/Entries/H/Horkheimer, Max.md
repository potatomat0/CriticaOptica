[[Horkheimer, Max]]
(1895--1973) German philosopher and one of the founders of the
[[Frankfurt School]].
Horkheimer was a superb organizer, who did an enormous amount behind the
scenes to facilitate the research of the Frankfurt School scholars both
in Germany and the US. From an early age, and in spite of---or perhaps
because of---his privileged upbringing, Horkheimer had a powerful sense
of the social injustices of the capitalist system.
He was born in Stuttgart, into a family of wealthy Jewish textile
manufacturers. Initially he followed his father's footsteps into the
family business, but his heart was never in it. He was conscripted in
1917, but was rejected as unfit for service on medical grounds. In 1919
he finally enrolled at university to study psychology, philosophy, and
economics in Munich. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the
revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned. On
his release, he transferred his studies to Frankfurt. He spent a year at
Freiburg studying with [[Husserl, Edmund]] and met his
research assistant [[Heidegger, Martin]]. He completed a
doctorate and habilitation under the direction of Hans Cornelius (the
same professor who would later fail Horkheimer's friends [[Adorno, Theodor]] and [[Benjamin, Walter]]).
In 1930 Horkheimer became director of the Institut für Sozialforschung
(Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt). His inaugural address,
given in 1931, 'The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks
of an Institute for Social Research' outlined three key tasks: the
development of an inter-disciplinary approach to the study of society
(by which he meant combining philosophy and sociology, hitherto unheard
of in the German academic system); the reconstruction of the Marxian
project, so as to emphasize social and cultural issues rather than
exclusively economic problems; the explication of the interconnections
between society, economy, culture, and consciousness.
Under his direction the Institute funded and carried out research on the
German working class's 'psychic structure', which given the political
conditions of the time---the fact that the Nazi party was everywhere in
ascendance---was incredibly brave and provocative. Aware, albeit not
fully aware, of the danger this shift in the political situation
betokened, the Institute transferred its affairs to Geneva in 1931. It
relocated again in 1934, this time to Columbia University in New York.
Horkheimer moved to the US first and then arranged for his other
similarly exiled colleagues to follow, and in due course most of them
did with the signal and sad exception of Benjamin. There the Institute
began on an extensive qualitative and quantitative project on
[[authority]] and the family.
However, in 1939, due to some bad investments, the Institute found
itself in financial difficulty and the amazing team of researchers it
had assembled began to break up and of necessity take jobs elsewhere.
'Traditionelle und Kritische Theorie' ('Traditional and Critical
Theory'), Horkheimer's most famous essay, and a kind of signature piece
for the Frankfurt School as a whole, was published in 1937 in the
Institute's house journal, *Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung* (Journal
for Social Research). This established [[critical theory]] as a codeword for a
materialist form of social analysis which nonetheless eschewed any
connection with science, or what it referred to as [[instrumental reason]]. It could maintain
its connection with
[[psychoanalysis]] precisely
because it was not recognized as a science. This article foreshadowed in
many ways what is undoubtedly Horkheimer's best-known work, namely his
collaboration with Adorno, *Dialektik der Aufklärung* (1944), translated
as *Dialectic of Enlightenment* (1972), completed in the Institute's new
residence in exile, Los Angeles. In part this project set out to explain
the conditions under which Nazism could take hold of a society, but it
also wanted to show that it was very far from a uniquely German
phenomenon, which it did by demonstrating that mass media diminished
resistance to ideological messaging. This view would hold sway until the
early 1980s when [[Cultural Studies]] decided it was
elitist and overturned it in favour of more reception-oriented theory.
Horkheimer returned to Frankfurt in 1949 and the Institute reopened
there in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 he was rector of the university. In
1954 he returned to America to lecture at the University of Chicago. He
retired in 1955. Horkheimer wrote little in his last years, but he
remained an influential figure.
