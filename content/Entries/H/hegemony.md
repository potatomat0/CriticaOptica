[[hegemony]]

 At its most basic,
hegemony means political rule, or even political domination, of one
state over another, but it can also refer to the rule of one social
group over another within a single state. However, its usage in
[[critical theory]] tends to
be more complex than this because it is used to explain
[[culture]], specifically why
one set of beliefs or practices is associated with one culture and not
another. In this context, hegemony is generally thought of as a
paradoxical synthesis of consent and coercion whereby the former feels
as though it is freely given despite the fact it is underpinned by
powerful coercive structures and practices.
The term itself has a long history, as [[Anderson, Perry]] details in his
lucid account of the concept's development, *The H-Word: The Peripeteia
of Hegemony* (2017). It first appeared more than 2,000 years ago in the
work of the Greek historian Herodotus, where it is used to designate
leadership in an alliance of states, such as Sparta's leadership of the
coalition of Greek polities fighting together to defeat the Persian
invasion. But it fell out of usage from Aristotle's time until the
mid-eighteenth century, when it was picked up by German scholars to
analyse Prussia's place in Europe and give a positive spin to its
ambition to lead not only the federation of states that was to become
the united Germany, but the whole of Europe itself. Central to its
meaning in this instance and subsequently is the way it distinguishes a
form of power that is not based solely on oppression, but also contains
consent.
However, it was the Italian Marxist scholar [[Gramsci, Antonio]] who gave shape to
the concept as it is generally used today. He adopted the term hegemony
in his *Prison Notebooks* (1929--35), initially as a code-word for
[[ideology]] (his prison
writing was subject to censorship), but ultimately as a critique of and
replacement for ideology. Following Lenin, Gramsci argued that ideology
is necessary to any ruling power, even a progressive power, so it cannot
be considered intrinsically bad, as it often is. Ideology is an
organizing force, in Gramsci's view, that creates the psychological and
political terrain in which people acquire consciousness about their
social positions. Hegemony thus encompasses ideology, but also exceeds
it because unlike ideology it does not refer to consciousness of a
specific system of thought or body of ideas.
In Gramsci's wake, several leading Marxist theorists have contributed to
the development of the concept. Key amongst them have been [[Williams, Raymond]] in *Marxism and
Literature* (1977), [[Hall, Stuart]] in *The Hard Road to
Renewal* (1988), Terry Eagleton in *Ideology: An Introduction* (2007),
and Ranajit Guha---the founder of the explicitly Gramscian journal
*Subaltern Studies*---in *Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in
Colonial India* (1983), but probably the most influential has been
[[Laclau, Ernesto]] and Chantal
Mouffe's *Hegemony and Socialist Strategy* (1985) and its sequel, *On Populist Reason* (2004).
Hegemony is not something governments can achieve on their own; they
require the active complicity of the populations they administer. This
complicity, in turn, renders revolution difficult, if not impossible,
and that is what concerned Gramsci. For Gramsci, the clearest sign of
this is the willingness of a population not only to tolerate dreadful
living and working conditions, but to die to preserve them too.
[[Anderson, Benedict]]'s work
on the [[imagined community]]
demonstrates how the concept of nation functions in a hegemonic manner
to create a sense of bonding amongst a large group of people who could
not possibly know each other.
