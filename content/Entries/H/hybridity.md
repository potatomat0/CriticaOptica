[[hybridity]]

 A term used in
contemporary [[Postcolonial Studies]] to theorize and to a
certain degree celebrate a global state of mixedness---a mixedness of
cultures, races, ethnicities, nations, and so on. The term is drawn from
biology, where it is used to describe the intermingling of different
strains or species of plants and animals to produce 'new' species (the
mule, which is the offspring of a donkey and horse, is a perfect example
of a hybrid). Interestingly, in colonial and imperial discourse of the
nineteenth century, the term hybridity carried negative connotations and
was used primarily to signal what the 'white' races had to fear if
miscegenation was left unchecked. Its meaning has effectively been
reversed. In part, this is because an alternative affirmative use of the
term is available in the work of Russian literary critic and theorist
[[Bakhtin, Mikhail]], who uses
it in the development of his key concepts of the
[[carnivalesque]] and
[[dialogism]]. Today, the
term is probably most closely associated with [[Bhabha, Homi]], who uses the term
to stress the interdependence of colonizer and colonized, and to
therefore argue that one cannot claim a 'purity' of racial or national
identity. All identity, he maintains, is produced in a kind of [[pastiche]], which is 'in between'
the subject and their idealized other. The term is not without its
critics, however, even from within [[Postcolonial Studies]]: Aijaz Ahmad,
Chandra Talpade Mohanty, and Benita Parry have all offered critiques of
the term on the grounds that it is idealist and doesn't accurately
reflect the reality on the ground (in other words it doesn't pass what
Toni Morrison has wittily described as the 'taxi test', i.e. a hybrid
identity might be fine in theory but will a taxi still stop for you?).
These critics rightly point out that hybridity is too often used simply
to uncritically describe a state of being, rather than analyse it.
However, Nestor Garcia Canclini also offers a
[[utopia]] account of this
term, which suggests a far greater depth than Ahmad, Parry, and Mohanty
are prepared to credit.
