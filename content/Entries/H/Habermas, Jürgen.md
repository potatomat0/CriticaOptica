[[Habermas, Jürgen]]
 (1929--)


German philosopher, best known for concepts of [[communicative action]] and the [[public sphere]]. An immensely
influential figure, particularly in his native country, Habermas's
shadow looms large over almost every aspect of research in the human and
social sciences. The only comparable figures in terms of impact in this
field are [[Foucault, Michel]]
and Niklas  *Luhmann.
Habermas was born in Düsseldorf in Northern Germany, but he spent his
early life in Gummersbach, where his grandfather was the director of a
Protestant seminary. His father was the director of the Chamber of
Industry and Commerce in the neighbouring city of Cologne. In interviews
he has described his father as a Nazi sympathizer and admitted that like
Günter Grass he was a member of the Hitler Youth. This experience,
particularly Germany's defeat and the aftermath, including the Nuremberg
'War Crimes' trials, could not but be formative for Habermas, and they
left him a stern critic of politics. He completed his undergraduate
studies in philosophy at Göttingen and Zürich, then completed a
doctorate in 1954 at the University of Bonn entitled, *Das Absolute und
die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken* (The
absolute and history: on the contradiction in Schelling's thought). In
1956 he moved to Frankfurt to complete his habilitation at the home of
[[critical theory]], the
Institute for Social Research, under the direction of [[Adorno, Theodor]] and [[Horkheimer, Max]].
Interestingly, although Habermas would remain connected in some way or
another to the Institute for Social Research for the rest of his career,
he did not finish his habilitation there. He fell out with Horkheimer
over the direction his thesis should take, so he transferred to the
University of Marburg. In 1962, at the instigation of [[Gadamer, Hans-Georg]], Habermas was
offered a position at Heidelberg University, which he accepted, but two
years later he was lured back to Frankfurt by Adorno to take over
Horkheimer's recently vacated chair. He remained there until 1970, when
he moved to the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg. A decade later he
returned to Frankfurt and took over as director of the Institute for
Social Research. Beginning in the early 1980s, Habermas also accepted a
number of visiting professorships in the US.
Unusually for a dissertation, Habermas's first work, *Strukturwandel der
Öffentlichkeit; Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der Bürgerlichen
Gesellschaft* (1962), translated as *The Structural Transformation of
the Public Sphere: an Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society*
(1989), proved an enduring success. It introduces the important concept
of the public sphere, which is a realm in society where citizens can
freely express opinions relating to general or public interest topics.
Habermas treats the public sphere as a historical category and his
research focuses on how specific types of public sphere emerge and
correspondingly what causes their demise.
Post-structuralist critics like [[Lyotard, Jean-François]] are sharply
critical of the concept's inherent idealism, but it has nevertheless
proven highly useful for thinking through the transformations that have
shaped what is generally known today as
[[postmodernism]]. One of
Habermas's most influential pieces of work was a short essay he wrote
entitled 'Modernity---An Incomplete Project' (1983), which was a
polemical shot across the bow of postmodernism at the moment of its
birth. Rather than recognize the advent of a new era as many critics
(e.g. [[Jameson, Fredric]])
did at the start of the 1980s, Habermas took the counter-intuitive
position that [[modernity]],
i.e. the logical precursor to postmodernity, had not yet reached its
zenith, and, moreover, that its emancipatory project was worth
continuing with and shouldn't be abandoned so lightly.
Habermas's interest in the public sphere developed over the next two
decades into a general theory of society, culminating in his magnum opus
*Theorie des Kommunikativen Handelns* (1981), translated as *The Theory
of Communicative Action* (1984). Habermas's theory is that all social
life can be explained in terms of the ability of humans to communicate
with one another. Most important for Habermas is the ability to use
language to do things, not merely to command other people to perform a
particular act, but to change the very symbolic status of a person,
place, or object. In this last respect, he draws on and extends the
theory of [[performative]]
language developed by [[Austin, John Langshaw]] and [[bare life]] and [[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]]'s theory of
[[language games]]. Since the
publication of *The Theory of Communicative Action* Habermas has tried
to use the central theses of that work to analyse and critique ethical
and political issues relating to contemporary world events. The
culmination of this work is the magisterial *Faktizität und Geltung.
Beiträge zur Diskurstheorie des Rechts und des demokratischen
Rechtsstaats* (1992), translated as *Between Facts and Norms:
Contributions to a Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy* (1998). He was
awarded the 2005 Holberg Prize.
