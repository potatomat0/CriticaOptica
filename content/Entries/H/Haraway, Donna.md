[[Haraway, Donna]]
 (1944--)


American feminist cultural critic renowned for her works on the
intersections between humans and machines and humans and animals,
powerfully summarized in her two manifestos on cyborgs and [[companion species]]. Her work covers an
incredibly wide range of topics in the human and life sciences, but it
is particularly focused on the interfaces between the studies of animal
behaviour, on the one hand, and human behavior, on the other hand, and
the various ways the former is used to explain the latter and vice
versa.
Haraway was born in Denver, Colorado. Her father was sportswriter (a
fact she recalls fondly in *When Species Meet* (2008), which has a
section entitled 'Notes of a Sportswriter's Daughter') and her mother
was Irish-Catholic. In the interviews collected in *How Like a Leaf*
(2000) Haraway stresses the importance to her of her mother's
Catholicism and her own encounter with it. And even though she
subsequently moved away from organized religion, she still cites
Catholicism as an influence, particularly its doctrines of incarnation
and transubstantiation, which she reads as an example of the fusing of
the bodily (material) and the symbolic (semiotic), which is a constant
theme in her work.
Haraway studied zoology and philosophy at Colorado College and then
completed a PhD at Yale. She initially worked on biology as an
experimental practice, but she found she had little taste for laboratory
work. So, she shifted the focus of her thesis to the role of metaphor in
shaping research in developmental biology. Published as *Crystals,
Fabrics and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth-Century
Development Biology* (1976), Haraway's thesis argued that all
theoretical systems in biology depend upon an organizing metaphor. After
she graduated, she taught women's studies and general science at the
University of Hawaii and Johns Hopkins University before her appointment
in 1980 to the History of Consciousness programme at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, as America's first professor of Feminist Theory.
She has worked there ever since.
Haraway's work has gone through a number of distinct phases, but her
abiding question, throughout, is what is at stake in creating and
policing the boundary between what gets called 'nature' and what gets
called 'culture'. She is not interested in settling this question once
and for all; indeed, it is doubtful she would say that it was even
possible to do so. Rather, it is a question which she uses to trouble
accepted dogmas in the human and life sciences, particularly those
relating to sex and gender. Her approach is
[[dialectic]] in the
[[Marxism]] sense of the
word. She is concerned to show the way categories like nature and
culture subtly depend on and presuppose one another. Although this
approach resonates very strongly with
[[deconstruction]], Haraway
says she only came to French theory (by which she means
[[drive]] and
[[Spivak, Gayatri]]) late in her
formation as a scholar (despite the fact that both Yale and Johns
Hopkins were hotbeds of deconstruction in the period she was there). She
acknowledges a debt to
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[authority]] for their
concept of the
[[assemblage]], but
emphatically rejects their concept of becoming as unworldly. More
important to her were Whitehead,
[[desire]], and
[[Heidegger, Martin]].
Her second book, *Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World
of Modern Science* (1989), showed that humans' assumptions about
themselves are reflected in their analyses of animals, which in theories
of animal aggression, for example, mirror our own view of ourselves as
creatures driven by instincts. Drawing on [[Said, Edward]]'s concept of
[[Orientalism]], Haraway
coins the term 'Simian Orientalism' to characterize primatology's
propensity to project its views about humans onto primates and to see
primates as earlier, less developed versions of humans. Haraway uses the
history of primatology as a discipline as a lens through which to see
and bring more fully into the light the racial and national discourses
of colonialism and
[[cosmopolitanism]].
Written in the same period as *Primate Visions*, but published a couple
of years later, *Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature*
(1991) contains the previously published essay for which Haraway is
undoubtedly best known, 'A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and
Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century'. It also contains the
essay on situated knowledge, which can be read as a primer for how to
think and work like Haraway. It emphasizes the paradoxical need to
balance critical scepticism with empirical facts, to avoid facile
indecision and easy generalizations. Haraway rejects both
[[postmodernism]] and
[[realism]] and instead
argues for a position of unstable constellations of partial truths and
partial connections. Interestingly, she also rejects the label *posthumanist, though she is often classified as one.
Haraway's 'Cyborg Manifesto' was written on assignment for the journal
*Socialist Review*. The brief was to write a few pages envisioning what
was possible from the perspective of that historical juncture, which we
now think of as the start of the Reagan--Thatcher years and the birth of
the new world order now known as
[[globalization]]. ([[Jameson, Fredric]]'s essay on
[[postmodernism]] written in
the same period can be read as a companion piece. Interestingly, Jameson
was on Haraway's thesis committee at Yale and they were briefly
colleagues at Santa Cruz.) Haraway says the manifesto is a product of
its times, especially the militarization of information (informatics, as
it was known) that became such a dominant way of thinking during the
course of the Vietnam War. It was an attempt to think about the
implications of the conversion into data of every aspect of life.
Importantly, for Haraway, the cyborg should not be confused with the
android; it belongs to its own moment in time.
The 'Cyborg Manifesto' was remarkably prescient and has for this reason
been widely read as a critique of the way 'big data' are used today. But
Haraway did not want it to be read in purely negative terms; she was
also interested in and keen to explore further the utopian potential
embedded in this transformation. And it is undoubtedly this hopeful,
tricksterish dimension (as she calls it) that has enabled it to endure
beyond the confines of its immediate historical context. Its deep
connection to the science fiction of writers like Joanna Russ, Octavia
Butler, and Samuel Delany, as well as many others, gives the text a
utopian richness often missing from science and technology studies.
Haraway's next book, *Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium*.
*FemaleMan© _Meets_OncoMouse™* (1997), continues the themes of her work
on situated knowledge and cyborgs but does so in a way that spells out
more of a cautionary tale. An important target for her is something she
calls 'genetic fetishism', a concept that combines
[[Marxism]]'s notion of
[[commodity fetishism]] and
[[Lukács, György]]' concept of
[[reification]]. Haraway's
concern is the way discussions about genes and genetic engineering
'forgets' that genes are phantom objects. They do not exist on their
own, but are part and parcel of the complex network of interconnecting
parts that constitute the body in all its senses. Isolating the gene
from its links to the corporeal enables its commodification, making 'it'
the source of value.
For the past decade and a half, beginning with the *The Companion
Species Manifesto* (2003) and continuing with *When Species Meet*
(2008), Haraway's work has been focused on the limits and possibilities
of human--animal relations in an ethical and political sense. These are
overtly personal books, inspired by Haraway's own encounters with what
she lovingly refers to as 'critters'. Both books are attempts to think
through what it means to make a life with a non-human other,
specifically a dog in Haraway's own case, but by no means limited to
dogs in their scope. The central hypothesis underpinning this body of
work is the idea that beings do not pre-exist their relationship to one
another. Dogs are not dogs outside their relationship with humans, but
neither are humans the humans we think we are outside their relationship
with dogs.
Central to these books is the need to think about
[[ontology]] in a contingent,
non-dogmatic, non-transcendental fashion. Drawing on a wide body of work
in anthropology, Haraway conceptualizes this contingent ontology as
emergent and, in a sense, as a kind of dance. It calls on us to make
kith not kin, to develop and foster relations with all significant
others and not just those we produce ourselves. Her most recent work,
*Staying with Trouble* (2016), takes this a step further. It is a
utopian attempt to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its
inhabitants. Rejecting the concept of the Anthropocene as both
inadequate to the needs of our times and overly invested in the actions
of humans, Haraway instead proposes to refer to the current epoch as the
Chthulucene, which is derived from '*chthōn*', the Greek word for earth.
As with the previous books, it is premised on a complex ontology of
[[sympoiesis]], or
'making-with', rather than
[[autopoiesis]], or
'self-making'. Overall, it argues for a grounded approach to thinking
about the needs of the future.
