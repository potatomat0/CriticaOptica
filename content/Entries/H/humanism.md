[[humanism]]

 Any philosophy, or
political stance which emphasizes or privileges the welfare of humans
and assumes that only humans are capable of reason. In doing so,
humanism treats the human as an abstract universal; it is premised on
the paradoxical idea that all people should be treated the same,
regardless of who they are and what they have done as individuals,
solely on account of their humanity. In the 1950s, humanism was endorsed
by radical critics like [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]], who used it as a
slogan to counter nationalist and racist discourse. In the 1960s and
1970s, particularly with the rise of
[[structuralism]], authors
like [[Foucault, Michel]]
rejected the term humanism for its assumption that human means only one
thing and more especially for failing to register the degree to which
the human is a construction of history. Consistent with this view, there
has in fact arisen a
[[posthumanism]] movement
which tries to describe a vision of the world which does not start from
a position that prioritizes the human.
