[[historiography]]

 The study of
the writing of history, the way style, narrative, metaphors, and so on
affect how the historical record is received and understood. It can also
refer to debates within a particular field of academic history (e.g. the
history of Australia). The key point is that it does not refer to actual
events, or history as such, it only refers to the interpretation and
articulation of those events. It thus asks what counts as history and
more particularly which methods reliably produce history. Key figures in
this field include: [[Certeau, Michel de]], [[Foucault, Michel]], and [[White, Hayden]].
