[[hermeneutics]]

 The study of
the theory and the practice of interpreting texts. It dates back to
ancient times, when it was closely associated with the study of
[[rhetoric]]. Since the
beginning of the Christian era, however, it has mostly been connected to
religious study, both Christian and Muslim. At issue in both cases is
determining the correct way of reading scriptural texts. In the case of
the Bible, it is far from self-evident how it should be read. The
problems that have to be considered are manifold: first, there is
perpetual question of translation (it was not all written in the same
language); second, there is the question of the change in the meaning of
words over time (the Bible was not written all at once); third, there is
question of whether each of the contributing authors meant the same
thing by the same words; fourth, should the stories be treated as
allegories?; fifth, should the scripture be treated as fact? The list of
problems to be considered could easily be extended. It was not until the
eighteenth century that a secular form of hermeneutics was developed by
Friedrich Schleiermacher, who demonstrated that the interpretation of
all texts, not just sacred texts, is problematic for essentially the
same reasons, namely language's capacity for multiple meaning. His
solution was 
to anchor meaning in the psychology of the author. Thus,
Schleiermacher was the first to raise the question of authorial
intention, which would remain central to textual studies until the
middle of the twentieth century, arguing that it has to be understood in
context (a perspective that [[New Historicism]] maintains
today). In the latter half of the twentieth century, it is the work of
