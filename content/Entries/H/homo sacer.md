[[homo sacer]] 

Translated
literally as 'sacred man', this classical concept has attracted
significant attention in contemporary critical theory because Italian
philosopher [[Agamben, Giorgio]] has devoted
several books to exploring the intricacies of its multi-layered meaning.
*Homo sacer* is a paradoxical figure: it is the one who may not be
sacrificed, yet may be murdered with impunity. In this sense, the *homo sacer* is outside or beyond both divine and human law. Agamben's
provocative thesis is that the *homo sacer* is evidence not merely of an
original ambivalence in the notion of the sacred, as anthropology has
long contended, but that the realm of the political itself is
constituted by making an exception of the very people in whose name it
is created. The *homo sacer* thus emblematizes the sovereign's power
over life and death, the power to designate a life that is worth neither
saving nor killing. For Agamben, the most complete realization of *homo sacer* is the concentration-camp inmate, particularly the hapless
figures known in the colloquial language of the camps as '*die Muselm√§nner*' (i.e. the 'Muslims') because of their apparent surrender
to God or Fate. But rather than argue that *homo sacer* is a product of
Nazism, or totalitarian politics more generally, Agamben contends that
on the contrary it is the sheer possibility of so regarding human life
that enabled Nazism's exterminationist politics. The very same
possibility, he argues, is at the origin of democracy too, a fact that
is displayed in the way politics has been constituted as a
[[biopower]] focused on the
population not the individual. *See also* [bare
