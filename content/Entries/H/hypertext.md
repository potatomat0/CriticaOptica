[[hypertext]]

 Most often seen
on Internet pages, it is a kind of text which although not actually
present is nonetheless immediately available, usually by clicking on a
hyperlink. Its purpose is generally to embellish or add information to
the text preceding it. A footnote may also be considered a kind of
hypertext. The hypertext is in this sense on a separate spatial plane to
the regular text, but somehow on the same temporal plane. The design
idea behind hypertext is that it can be read simultaneously with the
main body of the text. [[Derrida, Jacques]]'s more creative
works, like *Glas* (1974), play on precisely this problematic.
