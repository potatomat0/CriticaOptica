[[heteroglossia]]

 An extension
of the concept of
[[dialogism]] conceived by
Russian linguist and literary critic [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]]. Literally it
means a mixture of tongues. For Bakhtin literature should strive to be
what he called double-voiced, by which he meant it should incorporate
the voice of others. The best examples of this type of literature
should, he thought, submerge the voice of the author altogether. But
Bakhtin also realized that the presence of different voices by
themselves was not sufficient to produce the utopian effect he prized,
particularly not if those different voices were all of the same type or
class of people. Tolstoy's work, according to Bakhtin, suffers
especially acutely from this problem in that it is almost entirely
populated by the aristocratic class and their various retainers, such
that even the peasants whom Tolstoy is said to have held in such high
esteem are only seen from the point of view of their masters. The better
writers, from this perspective, are those like Dickens and Dosteoevsky
whose works give voice to every class of people. For Bakhtin this can
never be achieved simply by representing or depicting other classes
(this is Tolstoy's fault); one must incorporate their voice into the
very style of the text itself. By means of parody and comedy (the larger
effects of which Bakhtin called
[[carnivalesque]]) the
socially subordinate can be not merely depicted or quoted but brought to
life, for in this way their subversive attitude to the social system
that imprisons them in their class position can also be felt and
understood. It is Dickens's combination of social realism and satire
that stands him above the other authors of his era (the other English
writer he approves of is Thackeray, who obviously shares this trait with
Dickens, albeit articulated differently). *See also*
