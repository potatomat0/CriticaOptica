[[Hall, Stuart]] 
(1932--2014)


Left-wing British sociologist and cultural critic instrumental in the
foundation of [[Cultural Studies]] as an academic
discipline in the UK. Born in Jamaica and educated there, Hall moved to
Bristol in the UK in 1951. He went to Merton College, Oxford as a Rhodes
Scholar, gaining an MA. He then took a position at Birmingham
University. Together with [[Williams, Raymond]], and [[Thompson, Edward Palmer]], he helped found
the Marxist journal *New Left Review* in 1960 and edited it for two
years before relinquishing the role to [[Anderson, Perry]]. In 1964 he was
invited by [[Hoggart, Richard]] to join the Centre
for Contemporary Cultural Studies. He remained with the centre for
fifteen years, becoming its director in 1968. Over the years, Hall
worked on a variety of collaborative projects at Birmingham (a pattern
that obtained for much of his career), each analysing a different aspect
of British life, such as those published as *Policing the Crisis:
Mugging, the State and Law and Order* (1978) and *Resistance through
Rituals* (1976), that were to form the basis of the discipline today
known as Cultural Studies. In contrast, to many of his sociology
colleagues around Britain, Hall was an early adopter of what came to be
known simply as 'theory', particularly the work of Italian Marxist
[[Gramsci, Antonio]] and the
French [[structuralism]]
[[Althusser, Louis]] and
[[Foucault, Michel]]. In 1979
he moved to the Open University, where he remained until retirement in
1997. With the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, Hall seemed to
find his vocation---documenting both the defeat of the Left and the
seemingly irrepressible rise of the Right---and wrote what is arguably
his most important book, the magisterial, if grim, *The Hard Road to
Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left* (1988). As with all his
work, this book sought to identify the representational means by which
[[hegemony]] is captured,
paying particular attention to the ideological manipulation of
[[identity]].
