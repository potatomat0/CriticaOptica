[[Heidegger, Martin]]
(1889--1976) German philosopher, generally regarded as one of the most
important of the twentieth century, not least because he is one of the
most divisive. He is a controversial figure too because of his active
involvement with the Nazis. His work is a major focal point for
post-World War II continental philosophy, particularly in France where
the backlash against
[[psychoanalysis]],
[[Marxism]], and [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] manifested as a
return to Heidegger. With the conspicuous exception of [[Deleuze, Gilles]], most of the
leading figures of
[[post-structuralism]] have
engaged extensively with Heidegger's thought (e.g. [[Bourdieu, Pierre]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Nancy, Jean-Luc]], [[Lacoue-Labarthe, Philippe]],
[[Lyotard, Jean-François]],
and [[Stiegler, Bernard]]).
Heidegger was in born in the town of Messkirch, in the Baden region of
Germany. His father was a sexton in the local parish and a cooper of
modest means. The local priest in Messkirch recognized his talent and
undertook to teach him Latin, thus enabling him to gain entrance into a
prestigious grammar school in Konstanz and from there into academia. He
completed his undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at Freiburg
University, where his teachers included [[Husserl, Edmund]], the founding
father of [[phenomenology]].
Initially Heidegger studied theology, but when ill-health showed him to
be unsuited to a life of the cloth he switched to philosophy. He
completed his studies in 1916, and then undertook war service, but not
active duty. After the war he worked as Husserl's assistant until 1923,
when he obtained a post at Marburg University.
Marburg dithered for years over making Heidegger's post permanent and in
the end managed to do so just in time for Heidegger to be lured back to
Freiburg to succeed his stalwart mentor Husserl. In the five years he
was at Marburg, however, Heidegger managed to complete the book that
many regard as the most significant work of philosophy of the twentieth
century, *Sein und Zeit* (1927), translated as *Being and Time* (1962).
Heidegger set out to tackle the one great philosophical problem
philosophy had in his view assiduously ignored, namely the problem of
being itself; his aim was to uncover the process whereby being-ness is
possible. His argument is that it is only possible because there is an
entity to whom being matters, this entity he termed
[[Dasein]]. Owing to the
difficulty of translating this neologism, which literally means
there-being, it is usually left untranslated (in some translations
*Dasein* is rendered as 'man', but in spite of the fact that *Dasein*
does imply humans, 'man' is too humanistic to be satisfactory).
In 1933, four months after Hitler was made Chancellor of Germany,
Heidegger was appointed Rector of Freiburg University. On the 1st of May
that year he joined the Nazi Party, and ostentatiously wore a swastika
lapel pin for years afterwards, even in the company of Jewish friends;
then on the 27th of May he gave his (now infamous) inaugural address as
rector in which he exhorted students to align themselves with the Führer
and embrace Germany's national destiny. As rector he implemented the
Nazi race laws, which meant extinguishing the university privileges of
his mentor and staunchest supporter Husserl. In spite of his obvious
support for National Socialism, the Nazis did not support Heidegger in
return and within a year he felt compelled to resign his post. He
thereafter described his period as rector as a failure.
At the end of the war, when the Allies occupied Germany, Heidegger was
called to account for his association with the Nazis. The Denazification
commission labelled him *Mitläufer* (fellow traveller) and in view of
his influence as an intellectual he was prohibited from teaching. He was
rehabilitated in 1951 and continued to teach until 1976. Today, no one
seriously disputes that Heidegger expressed sympathy for Nazism; the
question that remains is whether this sympathy was personal, or born of
philosophical conviction. His defenders argue that it was an unfortunate
quirk of character that had nothing to do with his philosophical
thinking, while others---notably [[Jaspers, Karl]] and [[Adorno, Theodor]]---claim his
philosophy was fascist at its core. His stunning failure to publicly
condemn the Holocaust is often cited as evidence of the latter case, as
is his seemingly callous equation of
[[modernity]] with gas
chambers.
