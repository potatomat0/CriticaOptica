[[hooks, bell]]
 (1952--)

 The
pen name of African-American feminist and social activist Gloria
Watkins. The pen name combines the names of her mother and grandmother
and is written in lower case to signify that it is the content of her
books rather than the name on the spine that is important. Since the
publication in 1981 of *Ain't I a Woman?: Black Women and Feminism*,
hooks has been highly critical of both [[Second Wave feminism]] for its neglect of
[[race]], and race studies
for its neglect of
[[gender]]. Thus she writes
against sexism within feminism and against racism within black
liberation movements. She has also written extensively on the mutually
reinforcing ways in which race and gender are used to subordinate women
in the [[public sphere]],
particularly media and politics. Like [[Gates, Henry Louis Jr]], she also has an
abiding concern for the preservation and popularization of
African-American culture. She is a vanguard author in [[Third Wave feminism]].
