[[Husserl, Edmund]]
(1859--1938) German philosopher, founder of
[[phenomenology]] and one of
the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. His work was a
significant influence on [[Heidegger, Martin]], [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]], [[Levinas, Emmanuel]], Alfred Schütz,
Rudolf Carnap, [[Ingarden, Roman]], and [[Derrida, Jacques]]. Husserl was a
prolific author, although he published relatively little in his own
lifetime---he left work amounting to some 40,000 pages, which is
steadily being published (at last count there were more than 27 volumes
in the growing edition of his complete works). There is a major archive
dedicated to his work in Leuven, Belgium.
Born in Prostějov in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in the Czech
Republic), into a Jewish family. He initially studied mathematics as an
undergraduate at the Universities of Leipzig and Berlin, then completed
a doctorate on calculus at the University of Vienna in 1883. Franz
Brentano was lecturing on psychology and philosophy at the University of
Vienna at that time and Husserl found himself drawn more and more in
that direction. Brentano was forced to resign his position because of
religious differences, so he advised Husserl to complete his
habilitation with Carl Stumpf at the University of Halle.
His habilitation, published in 1891 as *Philosophie der Arithmetik*
(Philosophy of Arithmetic), was still on mathematics, but with a decided
bent in the direction of psychology. Although he set out to provide a
logical foundation for the existence of numbers, his project was
severely criticized for psychologism by the logician [[Frege, Gottlob]]. Husserl
subsequently amended his ideas and developed his own critique of
psychologism in his next book, *Logische Untersuchungen* (1901),
translated as *Logical Investigations* (1913), which attempted to show
that concepts are not psychological. On the strength of this he was
appointed to a position at the University of Göttingen in 1901 and he
remained there until 1916, publishing two further volumes under the same
title. In doing so he created phenomenology as a science. Phenomenology
as Husserl conceived it is interested in discovering the specific
processes of the mental synthesis and the concepts by which they are
apprehended.
Phenomenology differs from psychology in that it is not
[[empiricism]] in its
approach and deals with the
[[essence]] of acts of
consciousness. It isn't empiricist because it questions the nature of
the given, i.e. it does not assume that what appears does so without
being shaped in some way by the determining influence of consciousness.
There is a difference between sense data being registered by our mind
and actually knowing what those sense data mean to us---even raw
[[affect]], such as the
feeling of heat, needs to be processed so as to be read by the mind as
meaning 'danger'. How this processing takes place is more or less the
sole concern of Husserl's research for the remainder of his career.
Phenomenology assumes that the world is as it appears to consciousness
and that the mind is capable of intuiting the reality of the world.
Phenomenology is not a form of
[[relativism]], but to avoid
the consequences of its own starting position it has to show that the
mind's processes are capable of doing this independently of what is
going on in the world. Husserl invented a method he called
[[epochē]] (usually
translated as 'bracketing'), or phenomenological reduction, which
enabled him to separate the act of consciousness---apperception---from
the intentional objects of consciousness.
In 1916, Husserl was appointed to a professorship in philosophy at the
University of Freiburg. He taught there for the remainder of his career.
It was there that he encountered his most famous students, such as
Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Levinas, but also future [[Vienna Circle]] philosophers Rudolf
Carnap and Moritz Schlick.
In his final years, he was treated extremely poorly by the Nazi regime,
which came to power in 1933. He was made to suffer considerable ignominy
by his illustrious but politically misguided protégé Martin Heidegger,
who (in his capacity as rector of Freiburg University) revoked his
emeritus status and even deleted the dedication to him from his book (it
was later restored). His books were added to the bonfires the Nazis held
to cleanse their libraries of the writings of Jewish authors. His
unpublished papers might have met the same fate were it not for the
actions of Belgian priest Hermann van Breda. It is for this reason that
the Husserl archive is today located in Leuven.
