[[historical materialism]]

 A
branch of [[Marxism]]
that---following [[Marx, Karl]]'s own
prescription---takes the position that the development of history is not
determined by the [[desire]]
or actions of specific human subjects, but is instead shaped by the
objective facts of material existence. History unfolds as the attempt by
humans to alter their natural environment to suit their particular
needs---this explains, in part, why technology developed at a faster
pace in colder climates, the need to defend against the environment was
much greater there than in, say, the tropics, where the climate is more
congenial. In order to meet their needs humans must work together and
produce not only the specific goods they need but
[[society]] itself. In doing
so, however, divisions between different groups of people whose
interests differ arise, the result of which is social antagonism. These
groups, which might have been artisans, farmers or merchants to begin
with, evolve into
[[class]], of which there
are three basic types: landowners, bourgeoisie (i.e. manufacturers and
merchants), and workers. The relationship between the classes is
[[dialectic]] according to
Marx inasmuch as their respective interests do not coincide. The working
through of this dialectic is referred to as [[class struggle]].
