[[Hjelmslev, Louis]]
(1899--1966) Danish linguist. Born in Copenhagen, Hjelmslev studied
comparative linguistics in Copenhagen, Prague, and Paris. In 1931 he
helped found the Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen, which modelled itself
on (and in some respects against) the [*Prague Linguistic
Circle](#Xb8ff35412c18c229e7488d73b5e18c25545c778) founded six years
earlier by a small group of like-minded linguists that included such
luminaries as [[Jakobson, Roman]], Jan Mayakovsky,
and Nikolai Trubetzkoy.
Although his own work concentrated specifically on understanding
language, aiming to develop a general theory of language, it has been
expanded upon by others---particularly [[Barthes, Roland]], [[Certeau, Michel de]], [[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[Eco, Umberto]], [[Foucault, Michel]], and [[Greimas, Algirdas Julien]]---to analyse a
broad range of cultural phenomena. He called this general theory
[[glossematics]] and intended
it to be a kind of algebra of language which cut across what he saw as
false distinctions between phonetics, morphology, syntax, lexicography,
and semantics. The reality of language usage, Hjelmslev argued,
necessitates a more complex system than traditional linguistics provides
and in his best-known book, *Omkring sprogteoriens grundl√¶ggelse*
(1943), translated as *Prolegomena to a Theory of Language* (1969), he
set out to provide exactly that.
