[[hysterical sublime]] 

[[Jameson, Fredric]] 's suggested term
for a reformulated vision of the
[[sublime]] (in
[[actant]]'s sense) focused on
technology rather than nature. Kant defined nature as sublime because it
consistently exceeds the capacity of human concepts to grasp either its
particularity or its generality. More practically, the caprices of
nature (e.g. variable soil quality, water supply, and so on) are, as
Marx recognized, what must be overcome in order for human society to be
able to satisfy its elementary needs. Until the middle of the twentieth
century, then, nature has been feared and admired in equal measure
because of humanity's seeming inability to control its forces. But with
the rapid advances technology made in the second half of the twentieth
century nature's pre-eminent position in western metaphysics began to
slide and technology took its place. At first, machines like steam
trains and motor cars made humans seem equal to or greater than nature,
but with the advent of digital technology a new type of machine emerged
that proved difficult to respond to cognitively: the awesome
capabilities of computers are beyond question, but as physical objects
they are rather unimpressive. We get no sense of what a computer is
capable of simply by looking at it, so from a representational point of
view what is always the most significant about computers is the vast
network of other computers they are able to tap into. The image of a
global matrix of interlocked machines from humble handheld mobile phones
to orbiting satellites is, Jameson suggests, a new form of the sublime
because technology is presented as exceeding human capacities and
categories. Jameson's key exhibits are drawn from cinema---e.g. *The Parallax View* (director, Pakula, 1974)---but he also acknowledges the
importance of literature, particularly cyberpunk, in developing this
notion. The hysterical or technological sublime is a constituent
component of Jameson's account of
[[postmodernism]] and a vital
precursor to his later notion of a [[geopolitical aesthetic]].
