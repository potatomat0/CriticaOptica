[[heterotopia]]

 In his 1967
lecture '*Des espaces autres*' (Of other spaces) [[Foucault, Michel]] proposed the
concept to describe spaces such as that of the cinema and the cemetery
which have the 'curious property' of being connected to other places via
a complex network of relations, but in such a way that they either
suspend, cancel out, or reverse those relations designated, reflected,
or represented by them. Heterotopias are explicitly defined in
contradistinction to [[Bachelard, Gaston]]'s 'inner
spaces', yet one senses that it is precisely the way these spaces seem
to externalize the inner realms of our imagination that captivates
Foucault's interest.
Foucault speculates that there are two kinds of spaces that have this
property of being at once in a network of relations and outside it as
well: [[utopia]] and
heterotopias. He dismisses utopias as essentially unreal and
concentrates on heterotopias which he insists are real places built into
the very institution of society, adding that they are in some way
realized utopias. There are, he thinks, two main types of heterotopia:
what he calls (doubtless for the want of better words) 'crisis
heterotopias' and 'deviation heterotopias', the former corresponding to
what anthropologist Victor Turner would more productively call 'liminal
spaces' and the latter what Foucault himself would more productively
call 'disciplinary spaces'. His examples of 'crisis heterotopias',
primarily taken from primitive society, include sacred or taboo places
reserved for adolescents, menstruating women, women in labour, and so
on. His impression is that such spaces have all but disappeared from
western society, although he hazards that there are some remnants still
around (the honeymoon hotel being his prime example). Anticipating
[[Deleuze, Gilles]]'s notion of the
'any-space-whatever', Foucault calls these places 'anywhere places',
that is places that are precisely not 'just anywhere' but nowhere. His
'deviation heterotopias' read like a catalogue of his past and future
works---he lists psychiatric hospitals, prisons, and old peoples' homes.
He qualifies this preliminary attempt at a typology by stating that
society can, more or less at will, change the nature and function of
heterotopias and indeed bring into existence new types of heterotopias.
In total Foucault offers six principles for a description of
heterotopia: the two already given--- (i) heterotopias are of a specific
type; (ii) heterotopias can be transformed, reinvented, or made
afresh---and the following four: (iii) heterotopias have the ability to
juxtapose in a single real place several emplacements that are
incompatible in themselves (cinema is his prime example of this); (iv)
heterotopias are connected to what he calls heterochronias, ruptures or
breaks in time; (v) heterotopias always presuppose a system of opening
and closing that isolates them and makes them penetrable at the same
time; (vi) heterotopias transform our relations with other real spaces
either to make us see them as less real or to compensate us for their
relative shoddiness ([[Baudrillard, Jean]] and [[Eco, Umberto]] are exponents of the
first proposition, while [[Said, Edward]] is an exponent of the
latter).
