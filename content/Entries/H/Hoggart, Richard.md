[[Hoggart, Richard]]
(1918--2014) Left-wing British literary historian and sociologist who
was instrumental in establishing [[Cultural Studies]]. Born and educated
in Leeds, Hoggart was with the Royal Artillery during World War II,
reaching the rank of captain. Hoggart's first academic job (like
[[Williams, Raymond]]'s) was
as a tutor in adult education at the University of Hull, a position he
held from 1946 until 1959. It was during these years that he wrote the
semi-autobiographical work for which he is still best known today: *The Uses of Literacy* (1957). A bestseller at the time, it was influential
for two main reasons: firstly, it broke with the
[[relativism]] tradition's
emphasis on high culture and demonstrated that there was an authentic
working-class culture worthy of consideration; second, it argued that
this tradition of working-class culture (which was his own) was under
threat of destruction from imported American popular culture. From Hull
he moved briefly to the University of Leicester and from there to
Birmingham University in 1962. There, together with [[Hall, Stuart]], he founded the
Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, which is regarded by many as
the birthplace of Cultural Studies as an academic discipline. He
directed the centre for a decade, then took a three-year position with
UNESCO, and finished his academic career as warden of Goldsmith's
College in London. Hoggart retired in 1984, but maintained an active
publishing schedule for many years, producing several further works
reflecting on the state of British cultural traditions.
[[homo sacer]] Translated
literally as 'sacred man', this classical concept has attracted
significant attention in contemporary critical theory because Italian
philosopher [[Agamben, Giorgio]] has devoted
several books to exploring the intricacies of its multi-layered meaning.
*Homo sacer* is a paradoxical figure: it is the one who may not be
sacrificed, yet may be murdered with impunity. In this sense, the *homo sacer* is outside or beyond both divine and human law. Agamben's
provocative thesis is that the *homo sacer* is evidence not merely of an
original ambivalence in the notion of the sacred, as anthropology has
long contended, but that the realm of the political itself is
constituted by making an exception of the very people in whose name it
is created. The *homo sacer* thus emblematizes the sovereign's power
over life and death, the power to designate a life that is worth neither
saving nor killing. For Agamben, the most complete realization of *homo sacer* is the concentration-camp inmate, particularly the hapless
figures known in the colloquial language of the camps as '*die Muselm√§nner*' (i.e. the 'Muslims') because of their apparent surrender
to God or Fate. But rather than argue that *homo sacer* is a product of
Nazism, or totalitarian politics more generally, Agamben contends that
on the contrary it is the sheer possibility of so regarding human life
that enabled Nazism's exterminationist politics. The very same
possibility, he argues, is at the origin of democracy too, a fact that
is displayed in the way politics has been constituted as a
[[biopower]] focused on the
population not the individual. *See also* [bare
