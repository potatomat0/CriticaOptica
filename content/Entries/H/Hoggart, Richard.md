[[Hoggart, Richard]]
(1918--2014) Left-wing British literary historian and sociologist who
was instrumental in establishing [[Cultural Studies]]. Born and educated
in Leeds, Hoggart was with the Royal Artillery during World War II,
reaching the rank of captain. Hoggart's first academic job (like
[[Williams, Raymond]]'s) was
as a tutor in adult education at the University of Hull, a position he
held from 1946 until 1959. It was during these years that he wrote the
semi-autobiographical work for which he is still best known today: *The Uses of Literacy* (1957). A bestseller at the time, it was influential
for two main reasons: firstly, it broke with the
[[relativism]] tradition's
emphasis on high culture and demonstrated that there was an authentic
working-class culture worthy of consideration; second, it argued that
this tradition of working-class culture (which was his own) was under
threat of destruction from imported American popular culture. From Hull
he moved briefly to the University of Leicester and from there to
Birmingham University in 1962. There, together with [[Hall, Stuart]], he founded the
Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, which is regarded by many as
the birthplace of Cultural Studies as an academic discipline. He
directed the centre for a decade, then took a three-year position with
UNESCO, and finished his academic career as warden of Goldsmith's
College in London. Hoggart retired in 1984, but maintained an active
publishing schedule for many years, producing several further works
reflecting on the state of British cultural traditions.
