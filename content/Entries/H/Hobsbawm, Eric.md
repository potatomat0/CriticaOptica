[[Hobsbawm, Eric]] 
(1917--2012)


British Marxist historian. Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Hobsbawm went to
school in Vienna and Berlin before moving to London in 1933. He gained
his BA and PhD from King's College, Cambridge, where he took an active
role in the Communist Party and met fellow Marxist [[Williams, Raymond]]. During World War
II Hobsbawm served in the Royal Engineers and the Royal Army Education
Corps. He was appointed lecturer in history at Birkbeck College, London,
in 1947, and apart from visiting positions in the US at Stanford and the
New School, effectively remained there for the rest of his career. A
prolific author, with an engaging style, and a capacious knowledge of
the arts and sciences, Hobsbawm was equally at home writing short pieces
for popular magazines and newspapers or in lengthy treatments. He even
did a ten-year stint between 1955 and 1965 as the *New Statesman*'s jazz
critic, writing under the pseudonym Francis Newton (these pieces were
later collected and published under Hobsbawm's own name as *The Jazz
Scene* (1989). He is best known for the tetralogy on the 'ages of world
history', commencing with the *Age of Revolution 1789--1848* (1962) and
progressing from there to *The Age of Capital 1848--75* (1975), and *The Age of Empire 1875--1914* (1987), concluding with the controversial *Age of Extremes 1914--91* (1994), which offered an incisive account of what
Hobsbawm called the 'short 20th century'. Together with Terence Ranger
he edited *The Invention of Tradition* (1983), a collection of essays
which by demonstrating that many of the so-called traditional elements
of contemporary life (such as Scottish tartan) are in fact of recent
origin has had an enormous influence on [[Cultural Studies]].
