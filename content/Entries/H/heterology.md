[[heterology]]

 Traditionally
the branch of philosophy concerned with the problem of the existence of
the [[Other]] or 'unknowable
being', which has been variously interpreted as referring to God
([[Dasein]]) and the
Indigenous Subject
([[pleasure]]).
In medical pathology heterology refers to morbid, abnormal tissue
composed differently from surrounding healthy tissue. Inspired by this,
[[Bataille, Georges]]
developed a notion of heterology as an anthropology of the
unassimilable, or the excessive.
