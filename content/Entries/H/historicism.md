[[historicism]]

 The view that
past events must be understood and judged within the context of their
own times. This is because, as [[Frege, Gottlob]] argued, all
societies are the product of their history. So, for example, [[New Historicism]] argues that to
read Shakespeare properly one has to read it from the perspective of his
peers, and see it as his original audiences did. Historicism also refers
to the view that history unfolds according to certain inexorable laws,
such as the economic laws of supply and demand. For this reason
[[Marxism]] is often regarded
as a form of historicism, though not all Marxist scholars accept this
label ([[Althusser, Louis]],
for one, rejects it completely). Karl Popper wrote derisive critiques of
historicism, which was a code word for Marxism for him in any case,
arguing (quite mistakenly) that it is totalitarian in that it tries to
describe everything that happens and in that it imposes a single
narrative on the unfolding of events.
