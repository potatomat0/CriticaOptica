[[Harvey, David]]
 (1935--)


British [[Marxism]]
geographer. One of the most widely respected and cited urban
geographers, Harvey has produced a distinguished body of work of more
than twenty books characterized by its trenchant critique of the effects
of capitalism, and it is perhaps best encapsulated by the Jeffersonian
slogan 'There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of
unequals' that he cites in his discussion of [[primitive accumulation]] in *A Companion
to Marx's Capital* (2010). From the earliest days of his career, in
*Social Justice and the City* (1973), Harvey made it clear that in his
view geography could not and should not remain objective in the face of
urban poverty and its causes, and he showed that in many cases it is the
result of a deliberate strategy on the part of capital. In *The Limits
of Capital* (1982), his most theoretically sophisticated work, Harvey
argues that property speculation is essential to capitalism's dynamic
and its Achilles heel (the 'Global Financial Crisis' of 2007--9, which
Harvey predicted in interviews given a year before the property crash
that ignited it, is ample evidence of this).
*The Condition of Postmodernity* (1989) is his most widely known work.
Doubtless this is because, in contrast to his previous books, which are
somewhat dry and technical offerings, it offers a rich account of the
social, cultural, and economic conditions of the period that would
become known as
[[postmodernity]], but was
better known then as either
[[post-industrial society]]
(following the work of [[Bell, Daniel]] and [[Touraine, Alain]]) or
post-[[Fordism]] (following
the work of [[Gramsci, Antonio]]). Characterized by
processes that set in motion what is now known as
[[globalization]], this era
was witness to the disempowering of labour, the offshoring of
manufacturing, and the financialization of industry, which Harvey
explains as a transition to what he calls flexible accumulation. This
entails a separation of profit-making from its underpinnings in
production---this is enabled by the stock market, where money can be
made trading shares in companies at prices that have no correspondence
with the actual viability or profitability of the company.
Perhaps the most enduring and most widely appreciated aspect of *The Condition of Postmodernity* is Harvey's discussion of what he calls
'time-space compression', which he links to his account of flexible
accumulation. This new phase of capitalism is predicated on new kinds of
organizational thinking, such as 'just-in-time' logistics, which
obviates the need for stockpiling, which coupled with more
niche-oriented marketing, has changed how we experience time in the
twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Similarly, increasingly rapid
changes in fashions and fads mean we experience time itself as rushing
along at a faster pace than it previously did. Combine this with rapid
travel such as today's air travel (compared to ships) and the knowledge
that products (like French cheeses, Harvey's example, which were once
the preserve of a handful of gourmet shops outside France but now are
readily available in supermarkets) can be shipped to any part of the
world, and our sense of space shifts too. The consequence of this, which
we now tend to take for granted, is an amazing cultural
heterogeneity---of people, things, tastes, sounds, and so
on---unthinkable less than a century ago and now the norm in most major
cities.
In succeeding years, Harvey has focused his work on certain key effects
of globalization and the process he calls accumulation by dispossession,
which is his updated version of
[[Marxism]]'s concept of
primitive accumulation. In *The New Imperialism* (2003) and *A Brief
History of Neoliberalism* (2005), he argues that since Marx's time
wholly new means of profiting from dispossession have opened up: he
mentions intellectual property rights and patenting, which have been
applied to medical inventions and discoveries, thus limiting their
benefits to those who can afford it; biopiracy, the pillaging of the
world's stockpile of biogenetic resources, without returning benefit to
local people; the enclosure of water resources; the pollution of the
atmosphere, and so on. In *Spaces of Global Capitalism* (2006) he argues
that property booms are both a theft of the future of young people and a
screen for an otherwise poor-performing economy.
Perhaps his most widely appreciated project, from a pedagogical
perspective, is his lectures on Marx's *Capital*. Beginning life as a
series of excellent YouTube lectures, but now available as books,
Harvey's *A Companion to Marx's Capital* (2010) and *A Companion to
Marx's Capital Volume 2* (2013) offer a marvellously concise and clear
introduction to Marx's famously dense works.

[Hegel, Georg Wilhelm
Friedrich](#X7985e7e4c51bc66eac05dcfd91c781a1f5be3f7) (1770--1831)
German philosopher, one of the most influential thinkers of all time.
His work casts an extremely long shadow and virtually every thinker in
[[critical theory]]
acknowledges his influence, even when---as in the case of someone like
[[Deleuze, Gilles]]---they go
to great lengths to avoid being or sounding like Hegel. [[Marx, Karl]] was an enthusiastic,
albeit highly critical, reader of Hegel, and as a consequence in Marxism
there is a very important stream of work known as Marxist-Hegelianism,
of which the best-known exponents are undoubtedly [[Jameson, Fredric]] and [[Žižek, Slavoj]]. In France, led by
[[Althusser, Louis]], there
was an equally powerful movement in Marxism aimed at severing the
connection between Marx and Hegel and it largely succeeded, with the
effect that
[[post-structuralism]] tend
to neglect Hegel, or worse, caricature him as a figure of evil (Jameson
even suggests that in French philosophy Hegel is a codeword for Stalin).
Hegel was a similarly potent influence on
[[deconstruction]],
[[existentialism]],
[[hermeneutics]], and
[[pragmatism]].
Hegel was born in Stuttgart, in south western Germany. His father was a
secretary in the Duke of Württemberg's revenue office. His mother died
when he was 13. A precocious talent, Hegel read extensively as a child
and excelled at school. At the age of 18, he entered a Protestant
seminary attached to the University of Tübingen, where his fellow
students included the future poet Friedrich Hölderlin and the future
philosopher Friedrich Schelling. The three became firm, lifelong
friends. After graduation, from 1793 until 1801, Hegel worked as a
private tutor for wealthy families in Berne and Frankfurt. Then, with
the assistance of Schelling, he moved to Jena, where he was given an
unsalaried position in the philosophy department. It was in Jena that
Hegel encountered Napoleon, whose armies devastated the city, whom he
famously described as a 'world-soul'.
His finances made precarious by the war, Hegel moved to Bamberg and
accepted the job of editor of the local newspaper there in 1807. His
first major book, *Phänomenologie des Geistes* (1807), translated as
*Phenomenology of Mind* (1910), appeared in the same year. Written
against tough deadlines, Hegel sent individual chapters to the publisher
and never had time to revise the whole text. The result is a text whose
very structure has been the subject of considerable debate. One of the
most influential philosophical works ever written, the *Phenomenology of
Mind* (also translated as *Phenomenology of Spirit*) serves as the point
of introduction for Hegel's entire philosophical edifice. Hegel takes
the radical step of arguing---contrary to
[[empiricism]]---that there
is nothing prior to the process of producing concepts that can serve as
the foundation for philosophy. There is in this sense no immediate
given, according to Hegel; all sense data are subject to the prior
existence of a conceptual apparatus that enables the mind to make sense
of its perceptions. This process of making sense is described by Hegel
as [[dialectic]].
The dialectic is undoubtedly the concept most closely associated with
Hegel's name (it is the concept that drew Marx's interest), but it is
also relatively poorly understood. The key to the dialectic is the
moment of transformation Hegel referred to as the negation of the
negation. Understanding is produced when the 'negative' sense data are
combined with the equally 'negative' concepts, each one supplying the
latter with what it lacks: sense data are negative because they are
insufficient to ground truth, while concepts are negative because they
are in and of themselves empty abstractions, but in combination they
each negate the other's negativity. According to Hegel, all knowledge is
produced in this fashion: we start with what is known and as more
information becomes available we negate that knowledge and obtain newer,
more sophisticated knowledge. This process is known as *Aufhebung*,
sometimes translated into English as 'sublation', though more often than
not left untranslated: it has the complex triple meaning of raising up,
preserving, and negating. Ultimately, what interests Hegel is the
process by which the self becomes conscious of itself.
A year after the publication of the *Phenomenology of Mind* he moved
again, to Nuremberg, this time to take on the job of headmaster of a
*Gymnasium* (high school), where he remained until 1816. During these
years he conceived of then composed his enormous three-volume
*Enzyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften* (1817), translated as
*Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences* (1970). In 1816 he was
given an appointment at Heidelberg University, then in 1818 he accepted
the chair in philosophy at the University of Berlin, at that time the
most prestigious position in the field in Germany. He continued to write
prolifically on art, history, and philosophy, contributing several works
to the philosophical canon that continue to be studied in detail today.
His magnum opus, according to most of his commentators, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (1812--16; 2nd edn, 1832), *The Science of Logic* (1989),
lays out in intricate detail Hegel's
[[metaphysics]] system.
Hegel is often described as either an idealist or a historicist or both
because his work is embedded in a model of history that is constantly
thrusting forward towards some---perhaps unrealizable---image of the
perfection which Hegel calls absolute being. It is this aspect of his
work that
[[post-structuralism]]
rejects. The progress of human history, for Hegel, is the march towards
self-determination, which is only achieved when full self-consciousness
is attained. In his view, self-consciousness is synonymous with freedom
and this is the basic story his later work tells. The best known
instance of this in Hegel's work is his account of the master/slave
relationship in the *Phenomenology of Mind*, an essay which is for many
readers emblematic of Hegel's work as a whole. Hegel famously argues
that the self-consciousness of both master and slave is in fact the
opposite of what they initially think it is: the slave thinks they have
no freedom but discovers that because of their servitude they have been
relieved of the burden of having to think about their
[[situation]], thus they
really do have freedom of consciousness; while the master realizes that
having to think about the need to enslave the other is in itself a
burden that reduces his freedom.
