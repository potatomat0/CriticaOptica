[[hysteria]]
 (*Hysterie*)

 A
widely used term to designate pathological symptoms of either a physical
or psychical nature for which no physiological cause is apparent.
Hysteria in this sense is often used as a pejorative for an imagined
illness. The word is derived from '*hystera*', the Greek word for
'uterus' or 'womb', and has its origin in the idea current in ancient
Egypt as well as classical Greece and Rome that the female reproductive
organ is able to move throughout the body and that this movement is
triggered by an unsatisfied longing for a child. For this reason, at
least until the middle part of the nineteenth-century hysteria was
thought to be an exclusively 'female malady' (as it was commonly
referred to in the Victorian era). Inspired by the great French
neurologist, Jean Charcot, [[Freud, Sigmund]] became interested in
hysteria, and in the course of the development of
[[psychoanalysis]] he
proposed an aetiology which starts from the premise that hysteria is the
product of psychical conflict between thoughts generated in the
[[unconscious]] and the
censor protecting the conscious. He identified two types of hysteria:
(i) conversion hysteria, in which this conflict is expressed in bodily
symptoms; (ii) [[anxiety]]
hysteria, in which the conflict is deflected onto an object, manifesting
as a phobia (e.g. fear of spiders).
