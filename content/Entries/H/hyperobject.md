[[hyperobject]]

 An object or
event whose dimensions in space and time are massive in relation to a
human life, eg. a black hole, the Amazon forest, an oilfield, and
especially climate. Coined by Timothy Morton in his book *The Ecological
Thought* (2010), the concept was originally intended to frame a
discussion about human actions that have consequences on a global scale
and will outlive the generation or generations responsible. It is in
this sense an extension of [[Beck, Ulrich]]'s concept of [[risk society]]. Morton was
particularly concerned to find a way to conceptualize lastingly toxic
human creations such as plastic and plutonium that will contaminate the
planet for centuries to come, therefore demanding that we find ways to
accommodate them into human existence and human ways of thinking today.
Our awareness of the world is thus inseparable from our sense that 'we'
as humans are destroying it, which means, Morton argues, contra [[Fukuyama, Francis]], that we have
(only just) reached the beginning of history rather than its end.
Clearly influenced by [[Heidegger, Martin]]'s thinking
(specifically his notion of 'being-towards-death'), Morton's position is
that it is only now that we have taken cognizance of the fact that
humans' actions are propelling us toward our end as a species that we
can begin the reclamation work (a term he takes from
[[psychoanalysis]]) of
building a post-capitalist existence. But, as he clarifies in a
book-length treatment, *Hyperobjects* (2013), he does not hold to the
ideology of 'unless we act now' the world is going to end; his strategy
is rather to say the world has already ended: now let us get on with
building a new world. Morton dates the end of the world with the
patenting of the coal-powered steam engine by James Watt in 1784, but he
rejects the notion that this precipitated 'climate change', preferring
instead to speak only of 'global warming' because the former is in fact
an effect of the latter. Hyperobjects place a demand to act on us, and
in this way can be understood as a form of humiliation, a displacement
equivalent to the Copernican turn because it amounts to the loss of the
idea that humans are masters of their own destiny. Morton describes the
effect of hyperobjects as a form of 'being-quake', a shuddering at the
very foundations of ontology. Hyperobjects are not problems that can be
solved, if by that one means restoring a previously existing order, so
they are literally
[[postmodern]] in the sense
that they belong to an era that no longer believes human ingenuity is
capable of solving all problems by means of technology.
