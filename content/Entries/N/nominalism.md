[[nominalism]]

 The condition
into which art, philosophy, and even thought itself descends in the
absence of a unitary and overarching idea or [[grand narrative]] (to borrow
[[Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois]]'s useful
term). [[Adorno, Theodor]]
used this term to criticize his friend [[Benjamin, Walter]]'s work on the
Paris arcades, condemning him for not providing a sturdy enough account
of the relation between the fragments he collected in his compendium of
[[modernity]]. The notion of
[[constellation]] was in some
senses meant to remedy this problem, but Benjamin didn't take it far
enough in Adorno's view. In his later work on aesthetics, Adorno saw
that nominalism was the problem facing all art in an era that had begun
to question the very nature and existence of art as such. Nominalism is,
as [[Jameson, Fredric]] points
out in his book on Adorno, both a philosophical tendency and a
historical event. It is the repudiation of the universal by the
particular that is possible because the historical moment itself defines
itself as a refusal of the universal. Jameson uses the concept of
nominalism to explain certain trends in
[[postmodernism]] that he sees
are born of an emphasis of the particular at the expense of the
universal (by which he means history)---his specific complaints are
directed at [[New Historicism]].
