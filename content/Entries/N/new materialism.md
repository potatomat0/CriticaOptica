[[new materialism]]

 A movement
in philosophy and cultural studies that took shape in the US and Europe
in the early 2000s. No single body of work can be said to have founded
new materialism, but the work of scholars like Stacey Alaimo, [[Barad, Karen]], Jane Bennett,
William Connolly, [[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]], [[Haraway, Donna]], [[Latour, Bruno]], and Tim Morton,
who combine philosophy and science, have been instrumental in building
critical interest across the humanities and social sciences in the
material underpinnings of daily life. Diana Coole and Samantha Frost, in
the introduction to their groundbreaking collection of essays *New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics* (2010), argue that the
turn towards new materialism was prompted by several different factors:
firstly, in the twentieth century advances in scientific knowledge and
practice have been so dazzling they compel humanistic attention---e.g.
the discovery of subatomic particles has raised questions about the very
nature of matter itself; secondly, many of the dazzling scientific
advances raise serious ethical and political questions---e.g., in an era
of assisted reproduction, cloning, organ transplants, and so on, all the
former ethical certainties concerning definitions of life and death have
been put into question; and thirdly, the growing sense that
[[constructivism]] models of
thinking are inadequate to the critical needs of a world that is rapidly
being reshaped by new developments in science and technology. With
regards to this last point, rising concern about the environment and
climate change has undoubtedly contributed to the feeling in certain
quarters that the humanities needs to get its hands and feet dirty again
after years of avoiding earthy materiality. Coole and Frost identify
three broad trends in the field of new materialism: a
[[posthumanism]]
reorientation of [[ontology]]
that conceives matter as 'lively' and possessing its own
[[agency]]; a
[[vitalism]] concern for
non-human and other-than-human forms of life, including the inorganic;
and lastly an interest in the relationship between material and the
political economy.
