[[nostalgia for the present]]
[[Jameson, Fredric]]'s
apparently paradoxical formulation naming the attraction of the
spectacle of the presence in the here and now of the past that certain
films seem to provide. His key exhibit is the Lawrence Kasdan film *Body Heat* (1981), starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. Jameson notes
that although it is set in present-day Florida, it is filmed in such a
way that all markers of contemporaneity are obscured, giving rise to the
illusion the actual time of the film is the 1940s, the period from which
its Technicolor® version of film noir *mise en scène* is borrowed. It is
this desire for the present of previous films that is central to the
concept. A more recent example of nostalgia for the present in cinema
would be Peter Jackson's remake of *King Kong* (2005), which depicts the
glamorous 'present' of 1930s New York.

[[nouveau roman]] **(new
novel)** A style of novel that emerged in France in the 1950s. A
precursor to the [[Nouvelle Vague]] (several *nouveau roman* authors either collaborated with film-makers or became
film-makers themselves---Marguerite Duras is undoubtedly the best-known
example), the *nouveau roman* is often referred to as 'plotless' because
of its rejection of conventional narrative forms. Developed as an
experiment in writing, the *nouveau roman* constantly pushed the
boundaries of intelligibility by deliberately flouting the norms of
realism, character, plotting, and so on. Not surprisingly, the initial
critical reaction to the *nouveau roman*, at least in the popular press,
was very far from favourable. And while the *nouveau roman* would be
championed by critics like [[Barthes, Roland]], it remained
something that only a very small minority of readers took an interest
in. The best-known proponent of the *nouveau roman* was Alain
Robbe-Grillet, who effectively wrote its manifesto in 1963 with the
publication of his collection of essays entitled, *Pour un nouveau
roman*, translated as *For a New Novel* (1965). Other important *nouveau roman* authors include: Michel Butor, Nathalie Sarraute, and Claude
Simon.

Practice of Writing* (1972).
[[Nouvelle Vague]] A film
movement, or moment, that was current in France in the late 1950s and
early 1960s. Also known as the French New Wave, *Nouvelle Vague* was
influenced by Italian
[[neorealism]] and similarly
rebelled against the prevailing national trend of big budget literary
adaptations and costume dramas. The term *Nouvelle Vague* was coined by
*L'Express* editor Françoise Giroud to describe the emergent youth
culture of the period. The association with cinema grew out of the
popularity of films like *Et Dieu créa la femme* (And God Created Woman,
1956), which was directed by a 28-year-old Roger Vadim. *Nouvelle Vague*
was a highly intellectual cinematic form and many of its most important
directors were film critics writing for *Cahiers du cinéma* who seized
the opportunity the demand for a *jeune cinéma* (young or youthful
cinema) presented (e.g. Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques
Rivette, Eric Rohmer, and François Truffaut). Not explicitly political,
*Nouvelle Vague* was nonetheless highly critical of the consumer culture
that was beginning to dominate French life at that time. Therefore it
sought to make films which did not conform to the safe commercial
formulas of the mainstream. So it did away with the establishing shot
and introduced the jump cut instead. It did away with standard narrative
trajectories and focused instead on the ambiguous complexities of human
relationships, which in real life do not have neat beginnings, middles,
or ends. Coinciding with the rise of [**auteur*
theory](#X96b398da0b87aa3c40c834fc2d63a28a9f11691), *Nouvelle Vague*
directors held to the idea that films could be imbued with a signature
style and did not have to be anonymous commodities.
