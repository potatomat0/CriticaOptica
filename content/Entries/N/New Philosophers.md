[[New Philosophers]]
**(*nouveaux philosophes*)** A group of young French philosophers who,
despite their previous attachments to Maoism, publicly broke with
[[Marxism]] in the early
1970s, following the publication of Russian dissident writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's account of the gulags in the Soviet Union. The very
loosely knit group included André Glucksmann, Alain Finkielkraut,
Bernard-Henri Lévy, and Guy Lardreau, argued that western philosophy,
but especially the Marxist-Hegelian tradition, had led to and
legitimated the gulags and was therefore to be rejected in favour of a
new philosophy not devoted to the totalizing goals of the older styles
of philosophical system. The highpoint of this line of thought, however,
came from outside the group in the form of [[Lyotard, Jean-François]]'s proclamation (in
his book on the
[[differend]]) that our
ethical duty is to wage war on totality. [[Foucault, Michel]] was claimed by
the New Philosophers as one of their own and though he gave several
sympathetic interviews to its members, it is clear that he was not
comfortable with their wholesale rejection of the Left. Foucault's
friend, [[Deleuze, Gilles]],
had no such sympathy and was utterly scathing in his rejection of the
New Philosophers as being neither new nor philosophers, but just a bunch
of grandstanding hacks playing to an anti-intellectual media.
