[[Nancy, Jean-Luc]]
 (1940--)


French post-structuralist philosopher. A prolific author of books on the
German Romantic tradition in philosophy, including its twentieth century
adherents such as [[Heidegger, Martin]].
Born in Caudéran, near Bordeaux, Nancy studied at lycées in Baden-Baden
and Bergerac, before pursuing university studies in Toulouse, then the
Sorbonne. At the Sorbonne, he studied with [[Canguilhem, Georges]] and [[Ricœur, Paul]], the latter
directing his thesis on
[[genre]]'s philosophy of
religion. After graduating from the Sorbonne he was given a position at
the University of Strasbourg, where he intended to complete a doctorate
in theology, though in the end he wrote on
[[actant]]. For his Doctorat
d'Êtat, which he completed at Toulouse in 1987, he wrote on the problem
of the experience of freedom in Kant, Schelling, and Hegel ([[Derrida, Jacques]] and [[Lyotard, Jean-François]] were both on the
examining committee).
Often seen as fellow traveller of Jacques Derrida, the latter in fact
saw Nancy as 'postdeconstructionist', which is a backhanded way of
acknowledging the originality of his work while stipulating that
deconstruction nevertheless conditions it. Nancy's work is primarily
concerned to develop philosophical critiques of political concepts such
as community, freedom, and indeed humanity. The principal purpose of
these critiques---which is consistent with Derrida's
[[deconstruction]]
project---is the identification of an ontologically 'pure' form of
political concepts, freed from their contamination by the
philosophically suspect interests of party and
[[ideology]]. Purity is,
however, impossible in Nancy's view because unity is impossible; for
Nancy ontology is only ever a matter of fragments whose relation to one
another is at best uncertain. In the years since his heart transplant,
Nancy's focus has shifted away from commentaries on other thinkers
towards the development of a philosophy of his own, albeit one guided by
the conviction that philosophical systems are impossible. It is in this
phase that he has produced what are widely regarded as his most
important works: *La Communauté désœuvrée* (1986), translated as *The Inoperative Community* (1991), *Être singulier pluriel* (1996),
translated as *Being Singular Plural* (2000), and *La Création du monde;
ou, La Mondialisation* (2002), translated as *The Creation of the World
or Globalization* (2007). Nancy is also widely known outside of academia
for his bestselling account of his heart transplant operation,
*L'Intrus* (2000) which was made into a film of the same name by Claire
Denis. He has also written several books in collaboration with his
University of Strasbourg colleague [[Lacoue-Labarthe, Philippe]].
