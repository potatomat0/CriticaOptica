[[Nietzsche, Friedrich]]
(1844--1900) German philosopher, generally ranked with [[Kant, Immanuel]] and [[Frege, Gottlob]] in terms of his
influence. Indeed, French philosopher [[Foucault, Michel]] ranks him as
equal to [[Marx, Karl]] and
[[Freud, Sigmund]] in terms of
his influence on twentieth-century thought. While this claim undoubtedly
has merit, it is perhaps difficult to see the justification for it at
first glance. It is true that Nietzscheanism isn't as widely known as
either [[Marxism]] or
[[psychoanalysis]] is, yet in
many ways it is Nietzsche's scepticism that opened the way for these
other two [[discursive formation]] (to use
Foucault's own terms). Adding to the mystery is the fact that Nietzsche
was scarcely known in his own lifetime; indeed his books sold so badly
he had to pay for them to be privately published. Yet in the twentieth
century there was no continental philosopher of note that did not
acknowledge Nietzsche's importance.
Nietzsche was born in Röcken, a small town near Leipzig in Germany. His
father, a former teacher, was the pastor of the local Lutheran church.
Nietzsche had a younger sister and brother as well. His sister is a
controversial figure in Nietzsche studies because of the hand she played
in distorting Nietzsche's work by selectively editing his final
unfinished manuscript, *Der Wille zur Macht* (The Will to Power) so as
to make it appear utterly anti-Semitic, which would later make it appear
amenable to the core ideological values of Nazism. Archival research in
the 1960s by two Italian philologists, Giorgio Colli and Mazzino
Montinari (who were preparing materials for a translation of the
complete works of Nietzsche), showed conclusively that *Der Wille zur
Macht* was a fabrication and in a very real sense 'did not exist'.
Nietzsche's sister cut more than 1500 pages from his text and reordered
the paragraphs to substantially alter their meaning. Indeed, the very
title was a fiction---Nietzsche himself saw the project as an attempt to
revalue all values.
Nietzsche's father died in 1849 necessitating a move to Naumberg, where
the family resided with his father's unmarried sisters. Nietzsche went
to seminary school in Naumberg, where he showed aptitude in a range of
subjects, including music. In 1864 he commenced theological studies at
the University of Bonn, but left after only one semester. He then moved
to the University of Leipzig to study philosophy. Before he had
completed his studies there he was, quite remarkably, offered a
professorship in philosophy at the University of Basel in 1869. At the
age of 24 he was and remains one of the youngest scholars to be offered
such a post. In 1870 he served for a year as a medical orderly in the
Prussian army then returned to his post in Basel, from which he observed
the formation of the German State under Bismarck with some distaste. In
his early years at Basel he was intimate with the musician Richard
Wagner, frequently visiting him and his family at their house on Lake
Lucerne.
Nietzsche's first book appeared in 1872, *Die Geburt der Tragödie aus
dem Geiste der Musik*, translated as *The Birth of Tragedy* (1993), but
in a pattern that was to be typical of all his books it was treated with
suspicion and ultimately disdain. The main problem was its style:
Nietzsche eschewed the classical model for the presentation and
development of a philosophical argumentation in favour of a more
speculative style that offended the sensibilities of his peers. Written
in part as defence of Wagner, *The Birth of Tragedy* was later disavowed
by Nietzsche, who felt the binary it constructed between Apollonine and
Dionysiac tendencies in art was overly simplistic. His next book,
*Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen* (1876), translated as *Untimely Meditations* (1997), consisted of four essays on German culture,
history, Wagner, and Schopenhauer. In his marvellous little portrait,
*Nietzsche* (1994), Michael Tanner recommends that this largely
neglected book be read alongside Matthew Arnold's near contemporary work
*Culture and Anarchy* (1869) as a kind of antidote. His future work
would jettison the narrative structure of these essays and aim for
something less readily digestible, not aphorisms exactly but something
close to that.
Nietzsche attended Wagner's music festival at Bayreuth in 1876 and was
so disappointed by its populist atmosphere that he decided to break with
Wagner altogether. He responded to this break, which he described as
personally shattering, with a prolific outpouring of writing. He wrote
almost a book a year for the next decade, including: *Menschliches,
Allzumenschliches*: *Ein Buch für freie Geister* (1878), translated as
*Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits* (1996); *Morgenröte.
Gedanken über die moralischen Vorurteile* (1881), translated as
*Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality* (1997); and *Die fröhliche Wissenschaft* (1882), translated as *The Gay Science* (1974).
This amazing productivity notwithstanding, in 1879 Nietzsche resigned
his position at the University of Basel. His health, never strong to
begin with, had deteriorated to such an extent that it became
impractical to continue working. For the next ten years he led a
peripatetic existence shuttling between Germany, Austria and Italy in
search of climate conducive to good health and writing.
In Turin in January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a psychotic breakdown.
Legend has it that he saw a horse being whipped in the Piazza Carlo
Alberto and ran towards it to protect it by placing his arms around its
neck. He then collapsed to the ground weeping. In the following couple
of days he wrote a handful of postcard length letters to close
friends---these are known as the *Wahnbriefe* (Madness Letters) because
of their incomprehensible content---after which he never wrote again.
The letters were so worrying for the recipients they arranged to bring
him back to Basel and have him placed in an asylum. In 1893, his sister
Elisabeth, who had been in Patagonia as part of a utopian group
attempting to create a new Germany, returned home and took over the care
of her brother. She also took control of his unpublished writings and
remade them in her own image. It isn't known exactly what struck
Nietzsche down. For a long time it was assumed that syphilis was the
cause, but that has lately been brought into question.
Although he was anti-religious, his position on religion was complex: he
argued that it is better to believe in God than to believe in nothing,
but that the belief in God had over time become such an empty gesture it
amounted to the same thing as believing in nothing. Nietzsche is
sometimes described as a
[[nihilism]], but this is a
mistake because nihilism was precisely what he was most opposed to. In
his philosophy he sought to trans-value or re-value the 'old' values so
as to avoid the abyss of nihilism. Nietzsche argued that humanity is
held back from making this leap because of its attachment to slave
morality, or what he referred to as
[[ressentiment]], the sense
that somehow the world owes the individual something and that is the
reason they haven't been able to get ahead. His answer to the problem is
the notion of the eternal return---if we could have life over again, it
would have to repeat itself in every detail or it would not be *our*
life, therefore we should live in such a way that if our life was
repeated we would be able to embrace it. In other words, we shouldn't
judge life, or seek to enchain it, we should live it to its maximum
potential.
