[[neostructuralism]] 

[[Frank, Manfred]] 's term for what is
more usually referred to as
[[post-structuralism]]. Frank
argues that post-structuralism is inappropriately named because the body
of work it refers to cannot be thought of or understood independently of
[[structuralism]]. In his
view, it is better thought of as neostructuralism because it can be seen
as a continuation of the structuralist project, with new means. As Frank
sees it, neostructuralism is an essentially French movement, albeit one
with adherents all over the world, that owes its impetus to the events
of [[May ’68]]. Astutely,
Frank identifies a common distaste for the metaphysical concepts of
domination and system linking the otherwise quite disparate work of
[[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[Foucault, Michel]], [[Kristeva, Julia]], and
[[Lyotard, Jean-François]].
But he is troubled by what he sees as an amoral celebration of the death
of the subject that goes together with this position.
