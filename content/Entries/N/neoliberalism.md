[[neoliberalism]]

 A new phase
in the development of the capitalist [[mode of production]]. But also a new
way of thinking about the relationship between economy and society. It
is not especially coherent or well-worked out, but its basic tenets are
plain enough. Proponents of neoliberalism advocate that strong private
property rights, free markets, and free trade are beneficial to humanity
as a whole because they give the entrepreneurial individual the maximum
opportunity to generate wealth for themselves. The role of the state,
according to this doctrine, is to facilitate this state of affairs by
maintaining law and order and most importantly the steady state of the
money supply by keeping interest rates and inflation low. It is not
considered the business of government to supply services such as energy,
infrastructure, or even water, so as far as possible this should be
handled by private corporations.
[[Marxism]] economists like
[[Harvey, David]] have
described this process as a renewed form of [[primitive accumulation]]. Pricing for
all goods and services, including vital services such as health, should
be left to the discretion of the market, regardless of whether or not
that creates inequality or excludes people from access to those goods
and services. The advent of neoliberalism in the mid-1970s spelled the
definitive end of the welfare state as a political model. One obvious
result of this has been the rise of the
[[precarity]], a class of
people created by the disenfranchising that occurred as government
withdrew from the management of the peoples' welfare as its core
business and instead focused on the needs of the market. Many of
neoliberalism's key trends---especially deregulation, privatization,
financialization, and the withdrawal of the state---were evident to
scholars of [[postmodernity]]
and [[globalization]] such as
David Harvey and [[Jameson, Fredric]] in the early
1980s, but the term itself did not gain currency until the early 2000s.
It has now become a kind of catch-all term for any political programme
or platform that prioritizes the interests of the financial markets over
the basic human needs of
[[society]]. In this regard,
it is not simply an economic model but also a social order and a
configuration of
[[power]]---hence its
importance to contemporary [[critical theory]].
