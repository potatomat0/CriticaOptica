[[nativism]]

 The desire to
return to, or restore, indigenous practices, beliefs, and cultural forms
inhibited, destroyed, or outlawed by a colonizing power. It generally
holds the view that indigenous practices are more authentic and
therefore more culturally nourishing than the adopted or imposed western
practices. The discourse of nativism became especially prominent in the
1950s, when the
[[decolonization]] process
was at its peak. It can be compared with
[[n√©gritude]], but its
focus is more narrow---rather than celebrate the shared fate of a
[[race]], it tends to
foreground absolute difference. Nativism is problematized in
[[Postcolonial Studies]] in
two ways: first, there is the question of to what extent it is even
possible to restore indigenous practices under conditions of modernity
(Cambodia's destruction of its western-style hospitals under Pol Pot in
the 1970s is an extreme version of this dilemma); second, there is the
question of the desirability of doing so, especially when these
practices would lead to the reduction of gains in rights on the part of
minority groups, women, and so on (as for example in Rwanda in the 1990s
when the assertion of one ethnic group's nativist ideas led to the near
genocide of the other). Chinua Achebe's novel *Things Fall Apart* (1958)
is a vivid working through of these troubling paradoxes.
