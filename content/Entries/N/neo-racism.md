[[neo-racism]] 

[[Balibar, Étienne]] 's term for the
prevalent new modality of racism he calls 'racism without race', which
emerged in the 1970s. Whereas racism used to be premised on the idea of
[[race]] as biological
heredity, now in the postcolonial era it tends to be focused on
'cultural differences'. It surfaces in debates about immigration,
assimilation, and multiculturalism and although its tone tends to be
respectful its intent is always to preserve the pillars of racial
segregation both ideologically and practically. Indeed, the very
question of whether or not immigration might cause 'cultural'
difficulties (whatever form these might take---e.g. the loss of cultural
distinctness, or dilution of tradition) is neo-racist in form according
to Balibar. Samuel P. Huntington's highly influential *The Clash of
Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order* (1998) is a highly
sophisticated example of neo-racism inasmuch as it insists on the
universality and immutability of ethnic characteristics.
