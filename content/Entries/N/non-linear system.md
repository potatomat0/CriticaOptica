[[non-linear system]]

 A
mathematical concept that describes a complex situation in which inputs
and outputs do not function proportionally. For example, as we have all
been made aware in recent times, a small change in the temperature of
the planet as a whole can cause massive changes in a great number of the
earth's systems, both artificial and natural. More simply put, a
non-linear system is one in which causation appears to be indirect.
Climate change is the indirect, unintended result of a similarly
non-linear process known as modernization. But even that does not go far
enough because not all the peoples on the planet have shown an interest
in [[modernity]], so if we
are to search for the true cause of climate change we have to ask why
one group of people pursued the path of industrialization and others did
not. *See also* [complexity
