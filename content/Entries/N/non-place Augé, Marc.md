[[non-place]] [[Augé, Marc]]

's term for generic
places such as bus and train stations and airports which, however
elaborate and grandiose, do not confer a feeling of place. As Gertrude
Stein famously said of Oakland, there is no 'there' in a non-place. In
direct contrast to places, which we tend to think of as being
relational, historical, and concerned with identity, non-places are
designed and intended for the frictionless passage of a nameless and
faceless multitude. The paradox of non-places, according to Augé, is
that anyone can feel 'at home' in them regardless of their actual
background because they are equally alienating to everyone. He means
that if we travel to a country that is otherwise culturally foreign to
us, then the most familiar and therefore homely aspect of that country
will be its generic non-places, which in this context appear universal.
Non-places may usefully be thought of as machines (in the same sense in
which [[Foucault, Michel]]
thought of the [[panopticon]]
as a machine) whose chief utility is their ability to substitute for,
and to improve upon, human interaction---the automatic turnstile is
faster than the conductor, the ATM more convenient than the bank, and
the credit card simpler than cash. Not as far-reaching as George
Ritzer's [[McDonaldization]]
thesis, but resonant with it nonetheless, Augé's argument is that the
increasing prevalence of non-places on a global scale is an index of
what he terms
[[supermodernity]], and the
experience of them its defining characteristic. Non-places are not the
cause of this epochal shift. The cause, though it is never actually
named by Augé, is [[late capitalism]].
