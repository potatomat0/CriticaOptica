[[New Historicism]]

 A movement
in literary and cultural criticism that began in the US in the late
1970s and early 1980s, largely in Renaissance and Shakespeare studies,
but eventually branching out to connect with a variety of other topic
areas such as [[Postcolonial Studies]]. [[Greenblatt, Stephen]]'s *Renaissance Self-Fashioning* (1980) is usually credited with being the inaugurating
text of the movement, although the term itself wasn't minted until *The Power of Forms in the English Renaissance* (1982). Greenblatt's name is
undoubtedly the one most closely associated with New Historicism, though
of course there are several others involved as well such as Catherine
Gallagher, Jeffrey Knapp, Louis Montrose, Stephen Orgel, and Walter Benn
Michaels. New Historicism does not have a specific methodology, at least
not one as rigorously worked out as, say,
[[psychoanalysis]] and is in
many respects anti-theoretical in its outlook. Its actual practice of
reading texts is not dissimilar to the model of 'close reading' espoused
by both [[New Criticism]] and
[[Practical Criticism]].
Where it differs from its precursors, however, is in its conviction that
literary texts can in fact tell us something about the world outside of
the text, something that both New Criticism and Practical Criticism
explicitly proscribe. But unlike [[historical materialism]], with which it
is frequently compared (not the least because Greenblatt studied with
[[Williams, Raymond]] at
Cambridge), it takes the view that the interpretation of cultural texts
better enables us to understand history, rather than the other way round
as historical materialism would insist. Opponents of New Historicism,
like [[Jameson, Fredric]],
argue that cultural texts are symptoms of history, whereas for New
Historicism cultural texts are agents of history; they are the means by
which history is made. This view rests on the idea that history itself
comprises performances, representations, and symbolic exchanges. New
Historicism draws on the work of [[Foucault, Michel]], particularly his
late work on power and
[[subject]], as well as
[[Geertz, Clifford]],
especially his concept of 'thick description'.
