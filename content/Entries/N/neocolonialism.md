[[neocolonialism]]

 The
perseverance or renewal of colonial institutions (particularly models
and style of governance), practices and thinking after
[[decolonization]]. The term
was proposed by the Ghanaian independence leader Kwame Nkrumah in
*Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism* (1965). His thesis is
that although countries such as his own Ghana achieved independence from
their previous colonial overlords, their economies and hence their
political situations continued to be defined and shaped by external
powers under the structural conditions now known as
[[globalization]]. This is
particularly true of resource-rich nations like Nigeria, which has
abundant oil, but little in the way of manufacturing, and is therefore
dependent on global markets for its wealth. Theorists of
[[Empire]], such as [[Hardt, Michael]] and [[Negri, Antonio]], see this condition
of neocolonialism as central to the new world order in which power
exerts itself temporally (through the flows of finance or people) rather
than spatially or territorially.
