[[Negri, Antonio]]
 (1933--)


Italian [[Marxism]] political
philosopher best known for his collaborative writings with [[Hardt, Michael]]. A measure of his
significance may be gauged from [[Foucault, Michel]]'s remark in 1980
that Negri had been imprisoned for his ideas---very few theorists can
claim that status.
Negri was born in Padua, in Italy. He became politically active at a
young age, via the Roman Catholic youth organization, '*Gioventù
Italiana di Azione Cattolica*', which he joined in the early 1950s. He
joined the Italian Socialist Party in 1956. He studied political theory
at the University of Padua and obtained a position there as a professor
upon graduation, teaching state and constitutional theory. In 1969 Negri
co-founded '*Potere Operaio*' (Workers' Power), a political group
advocating 'workerism' (*operaismo*) that organized protests in
factories on behalf of labour. The group disbanded in 1973 and Negri
joined the Autonomia Operaia Organizzata (Autonomous Workers'
Organization), contributing numerous theoretical articles.
In April 1979 Negri was arrested along with several other members of the
Autonomia movement and charged with several offences alleging a
connection with the '*Brigate Rosse*' (Red Brigades). Negri was also
charged with masterminding the Red Brigades' 1978 kidnapping and murder
of Aldo Moro, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party. He was
exonerated of the latter charge, but was nevertheless convicted on the
association charge and in 1984 sentenced (in absentia) to 30 years in
prison. He was given an additional four years on the charge of being
'morally responsible' for the violence of political activists in the
1960s and 1970s. He spent four years in jail waiting for his trial, in
which time he was elected to the Italian legislature on the Radical
Party's ticket. He was freed from prison on parliamentary privilege
grounds, but this was revoked by the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Rather
than return to prison he fled to France with the aid of Amnesty
International and [[Guattari, Félix]].
In France, he obtained a position at the University of Paris VIII in
Saint Denis, where his colleagues included [[Badiou, Alain]] and [[Deleuze, Gilles]]. It was while he
was teaching in Paris that he met a young student by the name of Michael
Hardt, with whom he would produce a number of collaborative works in the
decades to follow. In 1997 he returned to Italy to voluntarily serve out
his sentence, hoping the gesture would raise awareness concerning the
situation of the hundreds of other political exiles involved in radical
activities in the 1960s and 1970s. His sentence was commuted and in 2003
he was released. The time in prison was productive for Negri: the first
of his collaborations with Michael Hardt were completed there, *The Labor of Dionysus* (1994), which combined translations of older pieces
by Negri with some new pieces written by Hardt, and the international
bestseller *Empire* (2000).
It was the publication of *Empire* that catapulted both Negri and Hardt
to the front ranks of [[critical theory]]. The book appeared
shortly after the so-called 'Battle in Seattle' (November 1999) in which
the worldwide anti-globalization [[social movement]] shot to prominence
and it seemed to offer a powerful new message of hope. Hardt and Negri
propose that a new form of
[[sovereignty]] has emerged
since World War II, which they term
[[Empire]], and argue that it
is global in nature and already more potent than any nation state. They
also argue that the new global processes of manufacturing, managing
labour, and finance, known as
[[globalization]], are
changing the very composition of capital, and in doing so creating a new
class, which they term the
[[multitude]], and thereby
opening up a new chapter in the history of [[class struggle]]. In an era when
most other writers on the Left are making gloomy pronouncements about
the rise of neoconservativism, Hardt and Negri's work is a breath of
fresh air. Not surprisingly, then, *Empire* was a runaway bestseller.
The events of September 11, 2001, changed the international political
climate quite dramatically and Hardt and Negri's sequel to *Empire*,
*Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire* (2005) was,
comparatively speaking, cold-shouldered. The critics who greeted
*Empire* enthusiastically now sharpened their knives. In part this was
because *Multitude* does not really answer the questions raised by the
previous book---it still doesn't explain how the multitude will bring
about social change. Hardt and Negri tend to take the view that the
sheer fact that the multitude exists means that social change has
already occurred, and regardless of how technically accurate this might
be it doesn't satisfy most readers. Time will tell if the third volume
of the trilogy, *Commonwealth* (2009), will answer this demand.
The decade since the publication of *Empire* has been incredibly
productive for Negri. In addition to the Empire trilogy he has produced
several volumes of essays and interviews adding to and explaining the
basic theses entailed in that trilogy.

[[négritude]] **(blackness)**
A neologism coined by Martinican poet and politician [[Césaire, Aimé]] that appropriates
the derogatory '*nègre*' (whose cognates in English would include
'negro' and 'nigger') and turns it into a positive. The most famous
instance of this is in Césaire's powerful prose poem *Cahier d'un retour
au pays natal* (1939), translated as *Notebook of a Return to My Native
Land* (2001), which contains the line 'Haiti, where négritude stood up
for the first time and said it believed in its humanity'. The reference
to Haiti is in fact a reference to the leader of the slave revolt of
1791, Toussaint Louverture. As a movement, *négritude* was established
by a small group of African-Caribbean scholars in Paris in the
1930s---including the future leader of Senegal Léopold Sédar Senghor and
the poet Léon Damas---who, under the influence of the Harlem Renaissance
in the US (particularly the poet Langston Hughes, who spent time in
Paris in the early 1920s, but also [[Du Bois, W. E. B.]] and Jamaican-born
Marcus Garvey) as well as
[[Surrealism]] in Paris,
undertook a kind of mental decolonization through poetry and writing. It
was primarily aimed at celebrating African heritage (in a deliberately
essentialist manner), specifically an African personality or
affectivity, as a means of affirming existence in a racist,
white-dominated world. It took as its purview the entire black
[[diaspora]] as well as
Africa itself. This bold standpoint was praised by [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] in his famous
preface to Senghor's 1948 collection of poetry, *Anthologie de la
nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache de langue française* (Anthology of New
Black and Malagasy Poetry). *Négritude* was not without its critics,
however, even from within the black community. It was attacked by the
[[Creoleness]] writers for
its monolithic outlook; it was also attacked by Nigerian Nobel laureate
Wole Soyinka for accepting the inferior term handed out by the European
powers instead of constructing its own positive term. Soyinka saw in
*négritude* what he thought of as an unhealthy fetishism of the 'native'
state. Although it was an important movement for several decades, its
force is all but spent now.
