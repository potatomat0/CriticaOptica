[[narratology]]

 The study of
the structure, function, and effect of narrative initiated by [[Russian Formalism]] and developed into
a highly specialist sub-discipline by
[[structuralism]]. In
particular, narratology draws on the crucial distinction between
[[animal studies]]
developed by Russian Formalism which distinguishes between the actual
events in a story and the imaginative way these events are described. In
this respect, [[Propp, Vladimir]]'s analyses of the
formal structure or morphology of Russian folktales, which compared
hundreds of traditional stories and broke them down into 31 basic
narrative functions and 7 character types, was foundational. By
emphasizing form over content, narratology is able to show similarity
between stories that might otherwise appear to contain quite different
subject matter. Popular fiction studies provides a good example of this
by demonstrating the structural similarity of Mills & Boon romances and
Jane Austen's novels. The major narratological theorists after Propp are
[[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]],
[[Barthes, Roland]], [[Greimas, Algirdas Julien]], and [[Genette, Gérard]].
