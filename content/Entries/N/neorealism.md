[[neorealism]]

 An Italian
cinematic movement that lasted from 1942 to 1952. Luchino Visconti's
*Ossessione* (Obsession, 1942) is generally credited as being the first
neorealist film, but Roberto Rossellini's *Roma citt√† aperta* (Rome Open
City, 1945) is usually regarded as the archetype of the genre. Conceived
in response to the regulation of film content imposed by Mussolini's
Fascist regime which prohibited the depiction of crime or immorality
(indeed, anything that did not show Italy in the best possible light),
neorealism sought to counter the unreality of the propaganda films with
an aesthetic described by Rossellini as moral because its central
purpose was to confront audiences with their own reality. Neorealism's
aesthetic had four basic principles: (i) it should project a moment of
[[everyday life]] rather than
construct a fictional tale; (ii) it should focus on social reality, i.e.
the lives of the majority of people, the poor peasants and urban
dwellers eking out an existence under difficult conditions, not the
privileged few; (iii) it should use non-professional actors and
improvised script so as to preserve the natural speech rhythms of the
people it represents; (iv) and for the same reason it should film on
location using hand-held cameras, rather than in a studio.
Only one film, namely Vittorio De Sica's *Ladri di bicicletti* (The
Bicycle Thieves, 1948), actually adhered to all four of these precepts.
Neorealism was a significant influence on the French [[Nouvelle Vague]] as well as a host of
other directors such as the great Indian novelist and film-maker
Satyajit Ray. [[Deleuze, Gilles]], in his two-volume
'natural history' of cinema, cites neorealism as the moment when cinema
finally breaks free of an action-reaction mode of narrative and develops
a true cinema of ideas.
