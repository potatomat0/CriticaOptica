[[national allegory]]

 A type of
narrative whose essential subject is the nation state. Because the life
of a nation, large or small, exceeds the capacity of what any novel can
actually accommodate, narrative fiction of this type uses
[[allegory]] as a means of
expressing a dimension of existence greater than that of the lives of
its individual characters. National allegory tends to be focused on the
lives of ordinary people, however, rather than heads of state or
aristocracy, using their mundane daily struggles as a means of
illustrating the state of the nation. First conceived by [[Jameson, Fredric]] in his monograph
on Wyndham Lewis, *Fables of Aggression* (1979), and developed further
in an article entitled 'Third-World Literature in the Era of
Multinational Capitalism' (1986), national allegory is a highly
controversial concept and has been the subject of considerable debate,
particularly in [[Postcolonial Studies]]. Jameson suggests
that Semb√®ne Ousmane's novel *Xala* (1974) is a perfect illustration of
a national allegory because the predicament of its central characters
can only be fully understood from the perspective of the nation. *See also* [geopolitical
