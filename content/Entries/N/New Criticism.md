[[New Criticism]]

 A mode of
literary analysis that developed in the southern US in the 1930s and
1940s and became the dominant way of reading and thinking about
literature in the American academy until the advent of
[[structuralism]] in the
1960s.
New Criticism treats the literary work of art as a stand-alone,
self-sufficient object that can only be properly appreciated in
isolation. Careful attention to the specificity of language use, a
process usually referred to as 'close reading', should tell the reader
everything they need to know about a text. The New Critics regarded
every text (providing it was of a sufficiently high standard to be
deemed literary in the first place) as singular and ineffable, its
meaning unique and incapable of being expressed by any other means. For
this reason New Critics prized and all but insisted on 'difficulty' with
regard to language use (a preference which would later earn them the
charge of elitism), making it an essential cornerstone in their attempt
to define the 'good' literary object. By 'difficulty' the New Critics
essentially meant polysemy (as the structuralists would subsequently
call it) or multiple meanings. Like the [[Russian Formalism]] before them, and
with a similar zeal for the technical side of writing, the New Critics
wanted to distinguish literature from non-literature in purely formal
terms, which is to say purely on the basis of the language use.
The New Critics were inspired by [[Richards, Ivor Armstrong]]' famous
experiment with Cambridge students in which he gave them poems to
analyse but told them neither the title nor the author of the pieces
selected and interrogated their responses, finding them wanting in both
sensitivity and skill. The results of this experiment, written up in
*Practical Criticism: A Study of Literary Judgement* (1929), struck a
chord with the New Critics who also thought that literary studies needed
to be taught differently, with more rigour than it had been in the past.
New Criticism's immense influence in North America, which lasted well
into the 1980s, stems from the fact that it paid serious attention to
the problem of how to teach literature. In contrast to [[Practical Criticism]], which was very
much centred around F. R. Leavis in Cambridge, New Criticism had several
focal points---the key names in the field were: John Crowe Ransom, Allen
Tate, Cleanth Brooks, R. P. Blackmur, W. K. Wimsatt, and Monroe
Beardsley.
