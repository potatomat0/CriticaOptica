[[narcissism]]

 An intense form
of self-regard, or attraction to one's image. The term is derived from
Ancient Greek mythology, which tells of a young man called Narcissus so
fascinated by his own reflection that he drowns trying to embrace it.
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Freud, Sigmund]] adopted the term
from British sexologist Havelock Ellis to theorize male homosexuality as
sexual attraction to an image of oneself. Freud later rejected this as
an explanation of homosexuality, but he retained the concept of
narcissism to describe the situation in which
[[libido]] is withdrawn from
external [[object]] and
redirected towards the
[[ego]]. According to Freud,
this is how children begin life (a stage he refers to as primary
narcissism), and only gradually move away from this towards a situation
in which [[cathexis]] is
sought in the outside world.
