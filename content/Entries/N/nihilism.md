[[nihilism]]

 An intellectual
and political position premised by the rejection of all moral and
ethical values grounded in the belief that there is some kind of higher
authority or being (e.g. God, humanity, justice, nature, etc.). The term
itself derives from Ivan Turgenev's novel *Fathers and Sons* (1861),
where it is used to describe a generation of intellectuals who had
become disenchanted with bourgeois life in Russia because they saw it as
hollow.
