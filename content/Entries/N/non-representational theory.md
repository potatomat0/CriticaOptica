[[non-representational theory]]
A movement in human geography that aims to bring into critical focus
those routine and diverse aspects of daily life that generally go
unnoticed, even by the people who live and perform them, such as the
sensations we experience walking down the street and the bodily
knowledges we deploy in order to walk down the street. It is
non-representational theory because it is interested in the pre-personal
and pre-subject affects and bodily engagements that are not fully
present to the mind, and are not fully available to the mind. To
continue the example of walking down the street, this refers to the fact
that in walking we do not have to consciously tell our legs what to do
in order to walk: we just do it. Non-representational theory has three
key practical and theoretical commitments: firstly, it is thoroughly
materialist (it is in many ways a parallel or perhaps sub-branch of
[[new materialism]] in this
regard) in that it places no restriction on what kind of material it
considers---it treats all material as active, as doing something;
secondly, it pays particular attention to the
[[ontology]] of relations
which, following [[Deleuze, Gilles]], it treats as
external to its terms (i.e. the relation of being taller or shorter than
another person does not depend on the existence of that other person);
it gives consideration to [[transcultural]] entities as well as
entities that are present or absent. Ultimately, it may be said that
non-representational theory is a theory of emergence; it is interested
in the coming-into-being and the individuation of bodies, affects,
subjects, and practices. and it tracks these wherever they may be found,
regardless of how mundane or ordinary.
