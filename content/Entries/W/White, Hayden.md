[[White, Hayden]] 
(1928--2018)


American historian best known for his
[[post-structuralism]]
approach and his emphasis on the importance of
[[trope]] in
[[historiography]]. Educated
at Wayne State University and the University of Michigan, graduating
from the latter with a PhD in 1956, White worked at the University of
Rochester, [[COBRA]]
(University of
California Los Angeles), and for the bulk of his career at the
University of California Santa Cruz. White became internationally
renowned with the publication of *Metahistory: The Historical
Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe* (1973), a magisterial work
that changed the shape of historiography in the latter part of the
twentieth century, initiating what was subsequently thought of as
discursive turn in the field.
Discussing the work of the great historians and philosophers of history
of the nineteenth century, Jacob Burkhardt, Benedetto Croce, [[Frege, Gottlob]], Jules Michelet,
[[Nietzsche, Friedrich]], and
Leopold von Ranke, White argued that the writing of history is
determined by the choice of narrative type (e.g. comedy, farce, romance,
tragedy, etc.) and that this choice reflects
[[glocalization]] conviction.
White developed this line of thinking further in the *Tropics of
Discourse* (1978), coining the term 'tropology' to delineate his topic.
