[[Wallerstein, Immanuel]]
(1930--) American historian and sociologist, best known for the
elaboration of the world-systems theory. His initial training was in the
economic development of postcolonial Africa, but in the early 1970s he
started to take a broader, more global view of economic development in
recognition of the fact that the situation in Africa could not be
accounted for satisfactorily without taking into account factors (such
as international trade, information flows, strategic alliances, etc.)
that are now associated with the process known as
[[globalization]]. In
Wallerstein's view, globalization is merely an intensification of
processes that have been around since the dawn of humanity, not a
separate stage. This outlook in turn led to the development of his
world-systems theory, for which he is best known. World-systems theory
is perhaps better understood as a collection of theories, rather than a
single theory, because it binds together a number of different ways of
looking at the world. Wallerstein's key insight is that it is the
interrelations between nations that shape their fate and their future,
not their efforts as individual states. Wallerstein's historical
analyses also show that geographical location has an enormous influence
too---countries close to the centre of power (core) develop faster than
those at the periphery. And though the core is not a constant---once it
was Europe, now it is the US, and in the future it may be China---the
importance of the relation between core and periphery is. It is a
central factor in the economic growth of the global economy, as can be
seen in the relation today between the US as consumer and retailer of
manufactured goods made cheaply in China.
The first instalment of his three-volume work *The Modern World-System*
appeared in 1974, with the next two following in 1980 and 1989. Drawing
on [[Marx, Karl]]'s conviction
that the underlying economic factors have a determining effect on
cultural and ideological matters, as well as [[Braudel, Fernand]]'s historical
research on the creation of economic networks, Wallerstein offered a
revised form of [[dependency theory]] as a riposte to the
then fashionable Three Worlds model of the global economy. He argued
that economically and historically there is only *one* world, consisting
of very complex networks of relations. He overlays this model with a
distinction between core and periphery, arguing that it is the movement
between the two that functions as the true 'motor' of history.
Consistent with his own economic theory, Wallerstein predicts the end of
America's reign as the 'lone superpower' in *The Decline of American
Power* (2003), a book written on the eve of the invasion of Iraq.
Obviously it is too soon to tell if that prediction will prove accurate,
but it shows a perhaps
[[utopia]] conviction that
the future must be different from the present.
