[[wish-fulfilment]]
(*Wunscherfüllung*) The essential premise of [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s theory of
dream-interpretation. All dreams, he postulates, are the symbolic
fulfilment of wishes. He later extended this thesis to the
interpretation of
[[posthumanism]]. The
interpretation of dreams in
[[psychoanalysis]] turns,
then, on uncovering the wish (which isn't always obvious) underpinning a
particular dream. French psychoanalyst [[Lacan, Jacques]] offers a striking
defence of this thesis in one of his early seminars: he asks his
audience to consider how dreaming of a friend who had recently died
could stem from a wish-fulfilment? Everything would seem to point in the
opposite direction inasmuch that the last thing one would wish
concerning a friend is their death. Yet Lacan argues that the dream does
fulfil the wish of not wanting to forget that friend. [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] argue that the
dreams and more particularly the delusions of schizophrenia are
exceptions to this thesis.
