[[work]]

 and text (*œuvre* and
*texte*) French literary critic [[Barthes, Roland]] proposed this
distinction in the essay 'De l'œuvre au texte' (1971), translated as
'From Work to Text' (1977), which together with Jacques Derrida's 'La
Structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines'
(1966), translated as 'Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of
Human Sciences' (1978), is generally regarded as one of the inaugural
texts of
[[post-structuralism]],
representing a sea change within Barthes's own thinking. Referring to
the way Einstein's theory of relativity has necessitated that scientists
take into account the relativity of their frame of reference, with the
implication that there are no longer any absolutes in science (in their
place are undecidable limit points), Barthes proposes that
[[psychoanalysis]],
[[Marxism]], and
[[semiotics]] combined
necessitate a similar kind of rethinking of the cultural object. This
newly relativized cultural object---in which he includes the relations
between readers, writers and critics---is what he wants to call text (he
sometimes writes it as Text to underline the fact that it is an
ontological distinction he is trying to make). In contrast, work refers
to an older, Newtonian, conception of the cultural object, which is
self-contained, singular and closed. He compares the distinction to the
one [[Lacan, Jacques]] makes
between reality and the
[[real]]: the work belongs to
the order of reality inasmuch as it can be held in the hand, so to
speak, whereas the text is of the same order as the real, which is to
say it is a problematic or experimental field and not a concrete object.
It is rather the limit through which a work must pass if it wants to
attain what [[modernism]]
critics praised as the new. The distinction between work and text
restates and complicates the distinction Barthes previously made between
the readerly (work) and writerly (text). *See also* [readerly and
