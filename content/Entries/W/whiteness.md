[[whiteness]]

 A polemical
rubric for analysing the way in which the white peoples of Europe
constructed and perpetuate a discourse which uses skin pigmentation as a
political marker and privileges their own skin colour above all others.
It is a polemical term in the sense that although the term
[[race]] has been around for
centuries, it was rarely if ever applied to white peoples, as though to
say only people of colour have race. As is also obvious, the very notion
of people of colour implies that being white is somehow the standard
against which skin pigmentation should be measured and judged. But by
the same token, it is the existence of those racialized others that
gives whiteness its meaning. Critical analysis of whiteness seeks to
expose the falseness of its position as the 'natural', 'normal', or
'given' term in any debate about skin colour. Whiteness studies is a
sub-branch of [[Postcolonial Studies]].
