[[Weber, Max]] 
(1864--1920)


German sociologist. One of the most important and influential scholars
of the twentieth century, considered by many to be one of the founders
of the discipline of sociology (along with
[[Durkheim, Ã‰mile]] and
[[intensity]]). His work broke
new ground by focusing on the individual as a meaning-seeking entity,
rather than as a member of an already existing, religiously bound
community. Weber rejected the idea that religious values could explain
individual and social behaviour, and argued against the idea that
investigating contemporary social life should be a search for absolute
truths (such as Adam Smith's 'law of the market'). He also rejected the
then (and in some places still) current idea that society can be
understood as a quasi-organic whole or system and that individuals
within it are merely so many 'socialized' component parts. Sociology's
primary aim, Weber argued, should be to explain the historical
individual.
Weber defines sociology as an interpretive science because it seeks to
understand the subjective meaning people attach to their behaviour
('social action') through rational and empathic modes of understanding.
According to Weber there are four main types of meaningful social
action: (1) means-end rational; (2) value-rational; (3) affectual; and
(4) traditional. Each type has its own ideal-type of motivation---e.g.
means--end rational action is motivated by a rational consideration of
all options and consequences and balancing up of the relative importance
of ends. Weber argues that these four modes of social action are present
in all types of civilization, throughout history. 'Modern' humans are no
more and no less rational than so-called 'primitive' peoples in this
regard. However, at certain moments in time one or other of these four
types of social action may become dominant. By using these ideal types
of action as starting points, the sociologist can imagine themselves
'into' the community they are studying and thus arrive at an
understanding of it. In order to achieve this, researchers have to set
aside their own values and beliefs and approach their subject matter in
an objective or 'value-neutral' manner.
The concept of the ideal type is one of Weber's most important
theoretical inventions and it grounds his entire sociology. The ideal
type is a logical construct born of empirical observation and pattern
recognition. The ideal type does not portray the subjective meaning of a
particular individual or that of all individuals. Rather, it points to a
constellation of subjective meanings typically associated with certain
kinds of easily recognizable social types and is used to make
broad-brush general comparisons. Undoubtedly his most important and most
widely known example of an ideal type is that of the Protestant worker
in his book *Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus*
(1904), translated as *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
Capitalism* (1930). Weber was fascinated by the way Protestants were
able to transform the acquisition of personal wealth, once considered a
sin, into evidence of their salvation (this transformation is at the
centre of [[Jameson, Fredric]]'s concept of the
vanishing mediator, which he draws from Weber).
Although the Protestant is the ideal type Weber is best known for
creating, it is not his best-known ideal type. That honour belongs to
the 'bureaucrat', but this ideal type is now so widely known and used
that it has passed into everyday usage and Weber's authorship of it is
all but forgotten. It is one of several powerful concepts that appear in
Weber's multi-volume but ultimately incomplete project entitled
*Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, Grundriss der verstehenden Soziologie*
(1921), translated as *Economy and Society* (1978), which was written in
the last decade of his life. It fell to Weber's wife to pull together
the mammoth manuscript of more than a thousand pages and publish it
following his death. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, for a work of such length,
its range of interests and concerns is breathtaking. Weber examines
issues to do with the state, the nation, class, ethnicity, family, and
clans, as well as cities, religions, and economies. His aim is to
systematize knowledge of all civilizations across history to enable both
a comparative historical analysis and an interpretive sociology.
The principle undercurrent of *Economy and Society* is an analytic
interest in the question of political legitimacy or
[[authority]], which may
usefully be compared with [[Gramsci, Antonio]]'s concept of
[[hegemony]]. Weber argued
that neither force nor material interest alone is sufficient to produce
a stable and enduring regime. The ruled, he argued, must believe, to
however small a degree, in the legitimacy of the ruler's right to rule
or else the regime will crumble. Their willingness to obey that ruler
arises out of this belief, which, according to Weber, follows three
distinct motivations: (1) rational--legal; (2) traditional; and (3)
charismatic. The rational--legal model is dominant in what is known as,
following Weber, bureaucratic societies---as Weber argued, bureaucracies
function best to the degree they are dehumanized, i.e. stripped of the
emotional elements normally associated with human behaviour. By
contrast, the charismatic model amplifies the emotional elements and
uses them to attach subjects to a particular leader who is thought to
possess extraordinary powers.
Large sections of *Economy and Society* are devoted to a comparative
analysis of world religions, or what Weber himself called
*Religionssoziologie*. A selection of this work was translated into
English as *The Sociology of Religion* (1963), more than a decade before
the complete edition of *Economy and Society* became available in
translation. It is widely regarded as a foundational text in the
sub-discipline of the sociology of religion. Weber starts with the
assumption that belief in the supernatural is universal, that every
society throughout history has posited some kind of higher being that
exists beyond earthly realms, and asks how organized religions evolve
out of these 'primitive' beliefs.
