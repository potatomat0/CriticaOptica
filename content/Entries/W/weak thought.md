[[weak thought]] 

**(*pensiero debole*)** A label applied to the work of Italian philosopher [[Vattimo, Gianni]]

. Although Vattimo
adopted this description of his thought, his own term for what he is
trying to do in his work is in fact 'weak ontology'. He derives the idea
of a weak [[ontology]] from
his reading of [[Heidegger, Martin]] and Heidegger's
student [[Gadamer, Hans-Georg]], whose key work he
translated into Italian. On Vattimo's reading of Heidegger there is a
profound separation between language and reality; language on this view
can at best convey an interpretation of reality, but never the thing
itself. Hence it is a 'weak' not 'strong' ontology. But in contrast to a
number of other philosophers in the
[[postmodern]]
[[anti-foundationalism]]
tradition, Vattimo does not interpret this state of being as a crisis
for [[metaphysics]]. He sees
it rather as a challenge to develop a more rigorous process of
interpretation.
