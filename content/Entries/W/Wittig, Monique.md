[[Wittig, Monique]]
(1935--2003) French
[[feminism]] critic and
author, and a self-described radical lesbian. Wittig's work argues that
the concept of 'woman' is a heterosexual construct. Thus, a lesbian is
not a woman, she claims, because her position outside of the
heterosexual matrix means she is no longer defined by the heterosexual
norm. Therefore that construction of both her gender and her sexuality
does not apply. Her best-known works are *Le Corps lesbien* (1973),
translated as *The Lesbian Body* (1975) and *The Straight Mind and Other
Essays* (1992). Wittig left France in 1976 and moved to the US and
started writing in English.
