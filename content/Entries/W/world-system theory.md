[[world-system theory]]

 An
explanation of human history that focuses on the development of
large-scale social systems such as banking, international trade,
geopolitical alliances, and technological advancement. It emerged in the
1970s via the work of the
[[Marxism]] economists and
historians, Samir Amin, André Gunder Frank, and [[Wallerstein, Immanuel]]. Influenced by
the [[Annales School]] of
history, its perspective is rigorously [[longue durée]], always taking things
back to the point of emergence of a particular type of system (thus it
tends to dismiss
[[globalization]] for failing
to observe that economic systems like capitalism have been global since
their inception). Moreover, it is rigorously international in its
geographical perspective (but is, nevertheless, mindful of the kinds of
geospatial iniquities [[dependency theory]] emphasizes).
