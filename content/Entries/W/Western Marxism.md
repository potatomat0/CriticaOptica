[[Western Marxism]]

 A general
category describing a sea change that occurred in the development of
[[Marxism]] following the
Russian Revolution in 1917. Scholars in Russia were expected to toe the
party line and focus their energies on ensuring the success of the
revolution at home. Meanwhile, scholars in the West found themselves cut
off from developments in Russia and perplexed by the failure of their
own countries to replicate events in the East. The failure was all the
more perplexing because of the fact that according to Marxist doctrine,
the socialist revolution should have occurred in the more highly
industrialized countries of the West rather than the largely agrarian
and still quite feudal Russia. Marx's faith in the inevitability of the
socialist revolution had to be abandoned in the face of this defeat and
that meant Marxism had to shift its focus and give thought to why the
expected revolutions failed to occur. By the end of the Second World
War, Western Marxism had become the almost exclusive preserve of the
academy---whereas figures like [[Gramsci, Antonio]] and [[Lukács, György]] had been active in
government, scholars like [[Benjamin, Walter]], and more
especially [[Adorno, Theodor]]
and [[Horkheimer, Max]] were
strictly academic. It also started to focus more on cultural rather than
economic problems and it is for this reason also known as cultural
Marxism. Today, the principal organ of Western Marxism is the British
journal *New Left Review*; among its contributors are many of the most
prominent figures in the field such as [[Anderson, Perry]], [[Eagleton, Terry]], and [[Jameson, Fredric]].
