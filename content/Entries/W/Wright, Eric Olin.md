[[Wright, Eric Olin]]
 (1947--)


American [[Marxism]]
sociologist. Born in Kansas, Wright did undergraduate studies at Harvard
and Oxford. He completed a PhD in sociology at Berkeley in 1976. He then
took a position at the University of Wisconsin, where he has remained
ever since. As is clear from the list of his principal publications, for
most of his career Wright's research has focused on the classical
Marxist problematic of
[[class]]---e.g. *Class,
Crisis and the State* (1978), *Classes* (1985), *Class Counts* (2000),
and *Approaches to Class Analysis* (2009)---but late in his career he
expanded his view to take in the question of
[[utopia]]. Wright's work
tries to resolve the two key problems in Marxism: (i) the apparently
anomalous existence of a middle class who are neither owners of the
means of production, nor completely at the mercy of the owners of the
means of production; (ii) the conflict between [[class struggle]] and technological
determinism as the principle factors driving history. Wright resolves
the first problem by treating the middle class as a contradictory class
and the latter by arguing that technological innovation gives impetus to
history, but doesn't drive it because ultimately technology has to be
adopted by humans for it to be effective.
