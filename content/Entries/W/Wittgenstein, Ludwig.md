[[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]]
(1889--1951) Austrian philosopher, generally regarded as one of the most
important of the twentieth century, not the least because his work
bridged the usually insuperable divide between [[analytic philosophy]] (particularly the
branch known as [[logical positivism]]) and continental
philosophy. His notion of [[language games]] played a very
important role in this regard. Wittgenstein's work was predominantly
concerned with the theory of meaning. An eccentric figure, his life
story has been the subject of film---*Wittgenstein* (1993), scripted by
[[Eagleton, Terry]] and
directed by Derek Jarman---as well as several speculative novels.
Biographers have had a field day with his life. Ray Monk's excellent
biography presents him as a tormented genius, while Kimberley Cornish's
more fanciful effort claims him as a Soviet spy linked to the so-called
Cambridge Five.
He was born in Vienna into a family of assimilated Jews. The children
were all baptized as Roman Catholics. Wittgenstein's father was one of
the wealthiest men in Europe. He made his fortune in iron and steel,
then at a quite young age consolidated his wealth into real estate and
retired from active involvement in his company so as to devote time to
the arts. He commissioned paintings by Klimt and sculptures by Rodin and
music from Mahler and Brahms. All the Wittgenstein children were
talented. His elder brother Paul was an internationally renowned
pianist, who even managed to continue on the concert circuit after
losing an arm in World War I. In such a household, Ludwig felt like
something of a failure. It was evidently an unhappy household, too, as
three of his brothers committed suicide, and all of them including
Ludwig suffered from depression.
Philosophy was something that Wittgenstein only became aware of when he
entered university. Initially he was interested in engineering,
particularly aeronautics, and this is what he studied, first in Berlin,
then in Manchester. While he was in England he started reading work on
the foundation of mathematics by Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand
Russell, and [[Frege, Gottlob]]. He visited the
latter, who advised him to study with Russell, so in 1911 he went to
Cambridge to do precisely that. Russell was immediately impressed by his
intelligence and encouraged his work. But to write and think properly,
Wittgenstein needed solitude, so in 1913 he took himself to an isolated
hut in Norway and there wrote what was effectively the first draft of
*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1921). Further work on it was delayed
by the outbreak of World War I. Wittgenstein returned to his native
country and volunteered for the army, and served in the artillery on
both the Russian and Italian fronts, winning several decorations for
valour.
On leave from the front, late in the summer of 1918, Wittgenstein
received the sad news that one of his closest friends had been killed in
an air crash. Almost suicidal with grief, Wittgenstein retreated to his
Uncle Paul's house, and there completed the final manuscript of
*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*. In spite of its later reputation as
one of the most important works of philosophy of the twentieth century,
it was initially very difficult to find a publisher willing to take it
on, and in all probability would not have been published without the
assistance of Bertrand Russell.
In Wittgenstein's own mind, the *Tractatus* had solved all the basic
problems of philosophy that interested him, so he decided there was no
point in pursuing a career as a philosopher. He opted to become a
primary school teacher instead. He also wanted to unburden himself of
his family legacy, so he gave his not inconsiderable inheritance to his
brothers and sisters and returned to Austria. But as perhaps might have
been expected, Wittgenstein was not well suited to the task of teaching
young children and he was forced to resign in 1926. In somewhat of a
slump and feeling a failure as a teacher, Wittgenstein worked for a time
as a gardener in a monastery and contemplated taking orders. He was
woken out of his mental and spiritual torpor by the offer from his
sister to design her new house. He leapt at the chance and designed a
house of such austere beauty that his other sister described it as being
fit only for gods, not humans. Wittgenstein slaved over every detail,
right down to the design of the window latches. The house still stands
today and is used as a cultural centre.
Moritz Schlick, the leading figure in the [[Vienna Circle]], contacted
Wittgenstein as he was completing work on the house and persuaded him to
meet with him and some of his colleagues, who were admirers of the
*Tractatus*. These meetings, which Wittgenstein often found very
frustrating, stimulated him into thinking he had more to give
philosophically speaking, and more importantly, started him thinking
that perhaps the *Tractatus* contained grave errors that needed to be
remedied. So in 1929 he returned to Cambridge. Reflecting on the
occasion, his friend John Maynard Keynes famously wrote to his wife:
'Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train.'
At Russell's suggestion the *Tractatus* was submitted as a PhD so that
Wittgenstein could obtain the requisite qualification to teach at
Cambridge (at that point he did not even have an undergraduate degree).
With extended sabbaticals in Russia, Norway, and Ireland, as well as a
long stint working as a medical orderly in Newcastle and London during
World War II, Wittgenstein worked at Cambridge until 1947. He resigned
his post then in order to concentrate on writing, which he found himself
unable to do in what he perceived to be the stifling atmosphere of
Cambridge. For the next three years, before he succumbed to cancer, he
led a peripatetic existence travelling and writing. Although the
*Tractatus* was the only work of philosophy published in his own
lifetime, he left behind hundreds of pages of manuscript that have since
been shaped into books and published, the most important of which is
undoubtedly *Philosophische Untersuchungen* (1953), translated as
*Philosophical Investigations* (1953).
It is customary to divide Wittgenstein's career into two parts---the
first part is determined by the abstract formalism of the *Tractatus*,
which rejects even its own meaningfulness because its meaning has to be
constructed on the basis of context; the second part is determined by
*Philosophical Investigations*, or the PI as it is usually known, which
does a complete turnaround and argues that it is only by dealing with
context that meaning is possible, and introduces the idea of the
language game to try to deal with it.
