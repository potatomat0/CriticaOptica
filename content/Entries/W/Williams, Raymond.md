[[Williams, Raymond]]
(1921--88) Welsh [[Marxism]]
literary and cultural critic who, through the elaboration of what he
called [[Cultural Materialism]] had an enormous
influence on [[Cultural Studies]] and [[New Historicism]].
Williams was born near the small railway and market town of Abergavenny
on the Welsh-English border. Although this was not a Welsh-speaking
region, Williams nonetheless identified very strongly with his Welsh
heritage, writing several novels on the theme in later life. He began
his undergraduate degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he also
joined the Communist Party and met people like [[Hobsbawm, Eric]], but interrupted
his studies in 1941 to join the army. He saw active service in Europe
during the Second World War as a tank commander, returning to Cambridge
in 1946 and completing his BA and MA. He then took a job at Oxford as an
adult education tutor, a position he held until 1961 when he was invited
back to Cambridge as a lecturer. He remained there until his retirement
in 1983, having been appointed professor in 1974. Among his most notable
students were [[Eagleton, Terry]] and [[Greenblatt, Stephen]].
His first books were on drama and criticism, but his reputation as a
critic of rare insight and distinction was made in 1958 with the
publication of *Culture and Society*. In it Williams explores the
changes in meaning of the idea of 'culture' from 1780 to 1950, arguing
that such changes record and reflect the changed conditions of everyday
life. He distances himself from the Leavisite model of [[Practical Criticism]], which took pains
to avoid any direct reference to society or what Williams describes as
'lived experience'. Eagleton's famous description of him as a
'Left-Leavisite' was perhaps a calculated insult. He followed this book
with *The Long Revolution* (1961), which theorizes in detail the
relationship between social relations, cultural institutions, and
subjectivity, with the aim of showing how progressive political ideas
emerge and become established as the norm. He expands the concepts of
[[structure of feeling]]
introduced in the early work, *Preface to Film* (1954) and of dominant,
residual, and emergent to explain the kinds of cultural mood shifts
required for ideological change to occur. This is developed further in
*Marxism and Literature* (1977).
In the early 1970s, Williams wrote several books that were to have a
formative and lasting impact on the incipient field of Cultural Studies:
*Communications* (1962), *Television* (1974), and *Keywords* (1976).
However his most influential book from this period was undoubtedly the
*Country and the City* (1973). A prolific author and an engaged public
intellectual, Williams was a towering influence on Anglophone literary
and cultural studies throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
