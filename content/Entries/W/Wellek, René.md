[[Wellek, Ren√©]] 
(1903--95)


Czech-American literary critic and comparativist. Born and raised in
Vienna, speaking both Czech and German at home, Wellek studied
linguistics and literature at the Charles University in Prague. After
graduation, with the aid of several fellowships, he was able to pursue
studies in the US and UK, developing his appreciation of English
literature until a lectureship became available at the Charles
University in 1930. He taught there for 5 years, becoming an active
participant in the meetings of the [[talking cure]], before accepting a
post at what is now part of University College London teaching Slavonic
language and literature. Funded by the Czech government, this position
was terminated when the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. Wellek chose to
immigrate to the US rather than return to Europe. He was found a job in
Iowa by his contacts in the US, where he worked for a few years before
moving to Yale. Wellek's reputation rests on the massive surveys of
literature and literary theory he compiled: *History of Modern
Criticism* (1955--91) and *Theory of Literature* (1949), which he
co-authored with Austin Warren. The latter work argued for a systematic
approach to the study of literature along the lines recommended by the
[[New Criticism]]. In his later
work, Wellek defended New Criticism against the critiques of
[[theory]] in both its
[[structuralism]] and
[[post-structuralism]]
guises. It is perhaps ironic then that he is memorialized today by a
lecture series at the University of California Irvine which is hosted by
the Institute for Critical Theory and is widely regarded as one of the
most prestigious lecture series for the promulgation of theory.
