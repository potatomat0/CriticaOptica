[[waning of affect]]

 A feature
of the new depthlessness in art attributed to the cultural
transformation known as
[[postmodernism]] as
described in [[Jameson, Fredric]]'s essay
'Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism' (1984).
According to Jameson, by the 1960s a new character type had emerged both
in fiction and in reality (in the form of the celebrity artist), which
because of its complexity could no longer be thought in terms of such
categories as the [[ego]], or
indeed the various pathologies of the ego enumerated by [[Freud, Sigmund]] such as
[[anxiety]] and
[[hysteria]]. Jameson
illustrates his point by comparing Vincent Van Gogh's 'A Pair of Boots'
(1887) with Andy Warhol's 'Diamond Dust Shoes' (1980). He argues that it
is possible to imagine the
[[situation]] that yielded
the former picture because it readily conjures an image of a tired
peasant flinging their boots against the wall at the end of a hard day's
toiling in the field, but we cannot do the same for the latter which
offers only a random collection of dead objects. For this reason,
Jameson argues, its impact on us has to be thought in terms of
[[intensity]] rather than
[[affect]] because we cannot
reconstruct the individual life or life-world which could serve as its
point of reference, or 
our anchor in the real. As a result, it has no
depth, by which Jameson means there is nothing behind or beyond the
picture that we can use to decode it. Its surface and its meaning are
one and the same.
