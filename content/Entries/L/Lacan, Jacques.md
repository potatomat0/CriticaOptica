[[Lacan, Jacques]] 
(1901--81)


French psychoanalyst and founder of [*École Freudienne de
Paris](#X1a3267e6c77679a01e7f19e5324c0c2dbf73d9b). Undoubtedly the most
influential psychoanalyst after Freud, Lacan combined
[[psychoanalysis]] with
[[semiotics]] to produce a
powerful theoretical synthesis that had an enormous influence over
almost the whole field of the human and social sciences, though nowhere
more so than in film studies where it became a virtual doctrine. Today,
Lacan's work continues to exert a strong influence thanks to the
tireless efforts of followers, particularly [[Žižek, Slavoj]].
The son of a wealthy merchant family, Lacan was raised a Catholic and
educated at the same school as future French President Charles de
Gaulle. He studied medicine and psychiatry at university but took an
active interest in the arts as well. As a student, he met the
[[Surrealism]] [[Breton, André]] and Philippe
Soupault and he heard James Joyce give readings of *Ulysses* (1922) at
the famous Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Co. He read
[[cathexis]] in the original
German and in 1923, at the tender age of 22, he encountered Freud's
theories.
It took several years, however, for Freud to become the focal point of
Lacan's interests. It was his reading of the Spanish Surrealist Salvador
Dalí's provocative essay 'L'Âne pourri' (The Rotten Donkey) that paved
the way by suggesting a new way of thinking about the connection between
the mind and language and shifting his focus of attention from
[[hysteria]] to
[[psychosis]]. Dalí argued
that paranoid delusions are not errors of perception, but creative
interpretations of reality that have their own distinctive logic. While
Dalí developed this thesis into a method he termed
[[dialectic]] paranoia, Lacan
set about rethinking what paranoia meant in clinical terms. The first
fruit of this labour was his PhD thesis, *De la psychose paranoïaque
dans ses rapports avec la personnalité* (Paranoid psychosis and its
relation to personality), defended in 1932. Although Lacan scrupulously
avoided any mention of his Surrealist inspiration in his thesis so as
not to put off the medical establishment, it was the Surrealists rather
than the psychiatric community who first recognized its brilliance.
For the next four years, as part of his training as a psychoanalyst
Lacan underwent analysis with the Jewish-Polish exile Rudolph
Loewenstein, during which time he wrote very little. In 1936 he began
attending the seminars of the Russian émigré philosopher [[Kojève, Alexandre]] who together with
his countryman [[Koyré, Alexandre]] introduced
[[genre]]'s thought to an
entire generation of French scholars. Following Kojève Lacan recognized
the distinction between an 'I' that thinks and an 'I' that wants, and
this became the basis of his renovation of psychoanalysis as a
philosophy of [[desire]].
Lacan's first major statement to this effect, which after a stumbling
start was to be his entrée to the world stage as a major psychoanalyst,
occurred in 1936 at the International Psychoanalytical Association
([[GIP]]) congress in
Marienbad. Lacan presented the first version of his paper on the
[[mirror stage]], arguing
that the child's sense of self is based upon a
[[misrecognition]]
('méconnaissance'). The child sees the image of itself in a mirror and
says 'that's me!' even though in actuality it is merely a reflection. By
this means the child attains an imaginary mastery over self. This
insight would later be taken up by the French Marxist [[Althusser, Louis]] in his
rethinking of the concept of
[[ideology]].
During World War II, Lacan worked as a military psychiatrist, writing
nothing for the duration of hostilities. He maintained his hand in the
field by corresponding with [[Klein, Melanie]], [[Balint, Michael]], [[Winnicott, Donald Woods]], and others, but
increasingly found himself at odds with them. After the war, Lacan's
profound disagreements with his peers in France and abroad over
theoretical issues as well as his refusal to desist from his
controversial practice of shortening analytic sessions to as little as
10 minutes instead of the IPA prescribed 60 minutes resulted in his
being ostracized by a large proportion of the professional
psychoanalytic community. In 1964, he founded his own group, École
Freudienne de Paris (The Freudian School of Paris), and broke
definitively with both the national and international psychoanalytic
statutory bodies. The membership list of this new school reads as a
virtual who's who of French theory---it includes such as figures as
[[Certeau, Michel de]], [[Guattari, Félix]], and [[Irigaray, Luce]]. Shortly before
his death Lacan unilaterally dissolved the École Freudienne de Paris.
Lacan's published output in his own lifetime was comparatively small. He
never wrote a straightforward or complete account of his theory. He
developed it in a peripatetic fashion through interventions at
conferences and his weekly seminars. In 1966 a large collection of his
conference papers running to some 900 pages was published under the
bland title of *Écrits* (the English translation is published under the
same title). In spite of its unwieldy size it sold 5,000 copies in two
weeks, which is unheard of for such an abstruse work. In the main,
however, Lacan's thought has been disseminated via the haphazard
publication of his seminars edited by his son-in-law Jacques-Alain
Miller. The product of transcriptions of Lacan's actual seminars and
subject to variable editorial control, these books are both stimulating
and frustrating, as rich in ideas as they are elusive in their
explanations of those ideas. Sadly, less than half of the seminars are
available in this form, but bootleg versions abound. Lacan's writing is
notoriously difficult and it is probably best to approach his work via
an expert guidebook.
Lacan's version of psychoanalysis is distinctive for its emphasis on the
concept of [[lack]]
('*manque*'). According to Lacan, having is never sufficient by itself
to extinguish wanting, therefore desire must be thought of as the gap
between the two. Even when we have what we want, it doesn't stop us from
wanting more, so in theory we never really have what we want. Desire is
in this sense impossible to fulfil.
Lacan was a prodigious inventor of concepts, many of which have passed
into the standard idiom of critical theory, e.g. [[floating signifier]],
[[imaginary]],
[[phallus]], [*objet (petit)
*a*](#Xab1e3b1ebad0e9a2e7bd309b42992175f19466c),
[[symbolic]], and
[[real]]. Perhaps his most
famous statement was his rallying cry that we must return to Freud. He
meant two things by this---firstly, and obviously, that we should read
Freud's texts (and not those of his followers), preferably in the
original German; secondly, and much more importantly, he meant that we
should focus on the analytic situation, namely the relation between
analyst and analysand, which is where psychoanalysis first took form.
