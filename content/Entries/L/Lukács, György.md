[[Lukács, György]] 
(1885--1971)


Hungarian [[Marxism]]
philosopher and literary critic, widely considered the founding figure
of western Marxism. Born to a wealthy Jewish family in Budapest---his
father was an investment banker---he studied in Budapest, Berlin, and
Heidelberg. In Germany he became friends with Max Weber, [[Bloch, Ernst]], and the poet Stefan
George. At this stage of his career, Lukács was still strongly
influenced by the work of
[[actant]],
[[genre]], and
[[alterity]], a fact reflected
in his still rather idealist early books: *Soul and Form* (1910) and
*The Theory of the Novel* (1916).
The First World War and more particularly the Russian Revolution had a
profound effect on Lukács. In 1918 he joined the Hungarian Communist
Party, serving as a People's Commissar for Education and Culture in the
short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic. When the Soviet collapsed he was
forced into exile in Vienna and was only saved from extradition and
probable execution (he was condemned to death in absentia) by the
intervention of writer friends like Thomas Mann (who reputedly based the
character Naphta in *Der Zauberberg* (1924), translated as *The Magic
Mountain* (1927) on Lukács). Vienna brought Lukács into contact with a
number of other similarly exiled Marxist intellectuals and fellow
revolutionaries like [[Gramsci, Antonio]], Adolf Joffe, and
Victor Serge and proved a rich environment in which to rethink many of
his previously held positions. The result was *History and Class
Consciousness* (1923), probably his most important book.
Although it was condemned at the time for being 'ultra-leftist' by the
Comintern, and later subjected to excoriating self-criticism by Lukács
himself, *History and Class Consciousness* has been immensely
influential in a number of disciplines. Lukács's goal in writing it was
to stimulate debate about the
[[dialectic]] and place it at
the centre of Marxist philosophy. As [[Jameson, Fredric]] explains in
*Marxism and Form* (1971), *History and Class Consciousness* criticizes
philosophy before Marx for its inability and/or unwillingness to come to
grips with the *totality* of social life. In particular, he denounces as
a false problem [[actant]]'s
concern for the impossibility of grasping the *Ding an sich* (thing in
itself), which according to Lukács is the result of middle-class
[[alienation]] and a
corresponding tendency to view the objects of the world contemplatively
rather than with an understanding of their materiality.
Lukács thus argues that the middle class can understand specific objects
but not the larger historical problem of how such things are possible in
the first place. In contrast, the
[[class]] conscious
proletariat is able to penetrate the truth of their situation and
dissolve the glacial state of
[[reification]] into which
the middle class are held fast by their [[commodity fetishism]]. Works that
demonstrate this awareness are designated
[[seriality]] by Lukács (he
singles out Balzac, Scott, and Tolstoy as his key exemplars), thus
setting the stage for one of the great literary critical debates of the
twentieth century between himself and [[Brecht, Bertolt]], whom he mistook
for an avatar of a
[[modernism]] understood as
mere formal experimentation. For Lukács realism means works that are
expressive of social forces. That is to say, the work must expose not
merely the living conditions of the poor as Dickens does, but also the
degree to which society at large is responsible for those conditions.
For this reason, he also rejected naturalism, particularly its chief
exponent Émile Zola, whose work he regarded as superficial.
In 1929 Lukács moved to Berlin, staying there until 1933 when the Nazis
came to power. He then fled to Moscow, where he remained until after
World War II, surviving both the German invasion of Russia and perhaps
more astonishingly Stalin's purges. His writings from Moscow, perhaps
out of political necessity, took on a dogmatically Stalinist tone. He
defended Soviet-dictated [[socialist realism]] and denounced
modernism. His key works from this period were *The Historical Novel*
(1937), *The Young Hegel* (1938), and *Studies in European Realism*
(1948). He returned to Budapest after the war and took an active, if
ambivalent role, in the political reconstruction of Hungary. In the late
1950s he joined Imre Nagy's revolutionary government, which opposed the
USSR. After the 1956 uprising, he was deported to Romania, once again
narrowly escaping execution. Fortunately, he was able to return to his
home country the following year and he engaged in an extended period of
self-criticism, which lasted more or less until his death, in which he
repudiated his former 'Stalinist' positions.
