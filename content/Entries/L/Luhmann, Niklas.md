[[Luhmann, Niklas]] 
(1927--98)


German sociologist and systems theorist. Luhmann is renowned for his
attempt to develop a sociological model capable of accounting for every
aspect of contemporary society. His work is enormously influential,
particularly in Germany, where it rivals [[Habermas, Jürgen]]'s dominance of
the social sciences. But unlike his peers, such as [[Adorno, Theodor]], he did not engage
with either [[Marxism]] or
[[critical theory]].
Luhmann was born in Lüneberg. In 1943, when he was only 16, he was
conscripted to serve in the Luftwaffenhelfer (as were Günter Grass, Pope
Benedict XVI, and Habermas). He was captured by the Americans in 1945
but soon released. After the war he studied law and had a career in the
law and public service (one of his duties was to deal with disgraced
professors who had lost their jobs because of their Nazi sympathies). In
1961 he was granted a sabbatical leave from his administrative job,
which he used to go to Harvard, where he met and studied with the great
American sociologist Talcott Parsons. He then completed postgraduate
qualifications in the School for Administration in Speyer, after which
he moved to the University of Münster to complete his habilitation. In
1970 he was appointed professor of sociology at the University of
Bielefeld, where he spent the remainder of his career, retiring in 1993.
As the title of his best known work, the monumental *Soziale Systeme:
Grundriß einer allgemeinen Theorie* (1984), translated as *Social Systems* (1995), makes apparent, Luhmann was primarily interested in the
way society functions. Luhmann adapted the notion of social systems from
Parsons, but contrary to Parsons Luhmann was more interested in the
functions of social structures---how they worked---rather than their
identity. Social systems are distinguished from biological systems,
physiochemical systems, and machines on the basis of their capacity to
produce meaning. He drew on [[Husserl, Edmund]] to theorize the
meaning-producing function of social systems, particularly their psychic
variants. Communication is the foundational element of Luhmann's social
systems. They consist of communication---communicative acts---and there
is no communication outside of the social system. Very far from being a
rigid [[structuralism]], as
the notion of systems theory might seem to imply, Luhmann was
particularly concerned to understand the way society adapts, the way it
deals with risk and cataclysm. Luhmann was, in part, inspired by the
work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, particularly their
groundbreaking book, *Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the
Living* (1972), which introduces the idea of
[[autopoiesis]], or the
self-creating system.
