[[lack]] 

(*manque*)

** The
motive cause of [[desire]] in
[[Lacan, Jacques]]'s theory of
[[psychoanalysis]]. What the
subject lacks is being, or rather the sense of being fully themselves.
The concept is indebted to [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s
[[existentialism]]
philosophy. Lack is synonymous with castration, which in Lacan's work
manifests as a rupture in the signifying chain preventing access to the
[[discipline]].
