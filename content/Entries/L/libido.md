[[libido]]

 The Latin word for
'desire' or 'wish' appropriated by
[[psychoanalysis]] to name
the psychical energy of the
[[id]]. [[Freud, Sigmund]] was the first to use
this term in this way, but it is now widely used, even outside of
psychoanalytic literature where it has become a 'polite' code phrase for
an individual's sexual appetite. Freud initially thought the libido was
exclusively sexual in nature, and confined to the
[[instinct]], so he opposed
it to the [[ego]], which is
the product of a compromise with the instincts; but he later came to
think that the ego also has libidinal energy and revised his theory
accordingly. In his more mature works, libido is the psychical dimension
of sexual excitation---its effects may be felt somatically, but it is
not a somatic concept. Libido is perhaps better understood as belonging
more to the order of the
[[drive]] than the instincts,
which chimes well with Freud's later positioning of it as the opposite
of the [[death-drive]]. Some
scholars, [[Jung, Carl]] and
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] in
particular, reject Freud's idea that libido is necessarily a sexual
energy and treat it as a kind of life-force, an energy pervading all
human activity.
