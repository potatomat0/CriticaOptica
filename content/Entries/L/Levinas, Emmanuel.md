[[Levinas, Emmanuel]]
(1906--95) Paris-based philosopher and commentator on the Talmud. Born
in Kovno, Russia (now Lithuania) to Jewish parents, Levinas began his
studies in philosophy in Strasbourg in 1923 where he met Charles
Blondel, Maurice Pradines, Henri Carterton, and [[Blanchot, Maurice]]. In 1928 he moved
to Freiburg University to study
[[phenomenology]] with
[[Husserl, Edmund]]. There he
met [[Heidegger, Martin]], who
was also studying with Husserl. Heidegger's *Sein und Zeit* (1926),
translated as *Being and Time* was to have a profound influence on him.
In 1930 Levinas returned to France and became a naturalized French
citizen. When Germany declared war on France, he was required to report
for military duty. He was duly mobilized and quickly captured and spent
most of the war, from 1940, as a prisoner in a camp near Hanover in
Germany. As a Jew, he was assigned to a barracks for Jewish prisoners.
It was during this period that he wrote *De l'existence à l'existant*
(1947), translated as *Existence and Existents* (1978), and the series
of lectures *Le Temps et l'autre* (1948), translated as *Time and Other*
(1987). Blanchot assisted Levinas's wife and daughter to find refuge in
a monastery. His mother in-law, as well as his father and brothers were
not so fortunate. They all perished at the hands of the Nazis.
After the war, Levinas worked as the Director of the Alliance Israélite
Universelle and he studied the Talmud with Monsieur Chouchani. He
published five volumes of Talmudic commentaries, the last of which was
published shortly after his death. Levinas's thinking was coloured by
his experiences in the war. Not surprisingly, he found it difficult to
forgive Heidegger, but at the same time felt he could not simply be
dismissed. Heidegger mapped out a boundary philosophy had to move
beyond, and much of Levinas's later works can be viewed as an attempt to
do precisely this. During the 1950s and 1960s Levinas became
increasingly critical of Heidegger, phenomenology, and ontology. In
contrast to Heidegger who continued to emphasize being in his work in
this period, Levinas wondered what there was other than being. His work
in this period shifted focus to ethics, which he argued can only be
thought in terms of our relationship with the
[[Other]], which for Levinas
was not simply God, but Mystery itself, that which can never be reduced
to or incorporated by the Same.
The concept of the Other, which Levinas contrasts to the other (by which
he meant other people), is central to much of Levinas's thought. In
effect, his entire philosophy revolves around this problematic and many
of the concepts he subsequently invents owe their origin to it as well.
If the Other cannot be reduced to the Same, then our relationship to it
has to be a 'relation without relation' as Levinas puts it. It is the
presence of the Other, which we can only sense as a kind of
[[face]] (*visage*), which is
Levinas's code phrase for the sense of epiphany the Other provokes in
us, that makes us realize that we share the world, that it is not ours
by right. His notion of ethics flows from this. Ethics for Levinas does
not simply mean determining how one should act, for him it entails a way
of both seeing and questioning the world: ethics is optics, he famously
pronounced.
Levinas's work in the late 1950s and early 1960s began to take on a more
distinctive character, becoming more his own thinking and less and less
a commentary on existing philosophies. It developed into what might be
termed an ethics of
[[alterity]], or perhaps even
a [[heterology]]. In 1961,
Levinas published his Doctorat d'Etat, the monumental *Totalité et
Infini*, translated as *Totality and Infinity* (1969) and in the same
year was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Poitiers, where he
remained until 1967 when he took up an appointment at Paris-Nanterre. In
1972 he published *Humanisme de l'autre homme*, translated as *Humanism of the Other* (2003). He moved to the Sorbonne in 1973. In 1974 he
published *Autrement qu'être ou Au-delà de l'essence*, translated as
*Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence* (1978). He retired in 1976, but
continued to publish prolifically as well as teach. *De Dieu qui vient à
l'idée* (1982), translated as *Of God Who Comes to Mind* (1998), and
*Entre Nous* (1991), translated as *Entre Nous* (2000), among several
other books were completed in the last two decades of his life.
Levinas's work was a major influence on French
[[existentialism]]. His
attempts to develop an ethics of alterity influenced [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]], [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]], and [[Derrida, Jacques]]. He died in Paris
on Christmas Day in 1995.
