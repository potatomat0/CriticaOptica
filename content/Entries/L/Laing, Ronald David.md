[[Laing, Ronald David]]
(1927--89) Controversial British psychiatrist and leading member of the
[[anti-psychiatry]] movement.
Born in Glasgow, Laing studied medicine at the University of Glasgow. He
was then drafted into the army, in spite of poor health, serving as a
psychiatrist in the medical corps. He left the army in 1953 and after a
brief stint at a Glasgow hospital moved to London to undertake training
in [[psychoanalysis]] at the
Tavistock Clinic, where he worked with [[Winnicott, Donald Woods]]. In 1965, along
with several colleagues, among them [[Cooper, David]], Laing founded the
Philadelphia Association and began an experimental community psychiatry
project at Kingsley Hall with a view to putting into practice the
reconceptualization of schizophrenia worked out in his books, *The Divided Self* (1960), *Self and Others* (1961), and *Sanity, Madness and
the Family* (1964). The idea was to create a shared living space for
schizophrenics and psychiatrists and approach the disease as a
shamanistic journey rather than an illness that can be cured with drugs
or electro-shock therapy. A famous, but in many ways discrediting
account of life at Kingsley Hall, written by one of the patients there,
Mary Barnes, and her psychiatrist, Joseph Berke, *Mary Barnes: Two
Accounts of A Journey Through Madness*, was published in 1971. Probably
his most influential book, *The Politics of Experience and the Bird of
Paradise* (1967), was written during this period. Very much a work of
its time, it draws on
[[Marxism]],
[[cathexis]],
[[Freud, Anna]],
[[Heidegger, Martin]], and
[[precarity]], to argue that
society as we know it in the west is mentally straitjacketing and that
is the reason so many people are unhappy. In this regard his work
anticipated the student protests of [[May ’68]] and was similarly quite
influential on [[Guattari, Félix]], though he
ultimately rejected anti-psychiatry. Because the anti-psychiatry
movement is generally seen to have failed, both by professional
psychiatrists and by critical theorists, as its therapeutic techniques
don't provide any relief from the distressing experiences schizophrenia
can induce, Laing's work has fallen into neglect.
