[[Lefebvre, Henri]] 
(1901--91)


French [[Marxism]]
philosopher and sociologist. Lefebvre published 70 books in his lifetime
on an incredibly wide array of topics, and is generally regarded as one
of the great theoreticians of the twentieth century. Because of his
interests in [[space]] and
[[everyday life]] (indeed his
name is virtually synonymous with these concepts), he tends to be read
more in geography departments than philosophy departments. Unfortunately
for Anglophone readers, the English translations of his work reflect
this bias.
Lefebvre was born in the rural town of Hegetmau just outside the
Pyrenees, France. And though he moved to Paris at an early age to study
at the Sorbonne, he retained a strong link with the countryside
throughout his life. In the 1920s Lefebvre taught philosophy in Paris
and was part of the small group of
anti-[[persona]], Marxist
thinkers known as the *Philosophies* group. He joined the Communist
Party (PCF) in 1928. In this period he took a keen interest in the work
of the [[Surrealism]], and
was a familiar of Tristan Tzara and [[Breton, André]], but it was a
short-lived passion. He soon came to think of Surrealism as an
inauthentic mode of critique and broke with it quite acrimoniously.
His career stalled in the late 1920s and early 1930s and he found work
as a cab driver and factory hand, a fact he would later claim gave him
greater right to speak about existence than
[[existentialism]] like
[[precarity]] who had never done
any physical labour. After a bad car accident, he was able to find work
as a teacher. Around this time he started reading
[[genre]] and through Hegel
discovered [[Marxism]]. During
the German occupation of France, Lefebvre was removed from his teaching
post because of his association with the PCF and his book on Nietzsche
was seized and burnt. He then went on to join the Resistance, writing
anti-Vichy pamphlets and (it is alleged) helping to blow up German
trains. Following the war he worked as an artistic director for a radio
station in Toulouse.
The first instalment of what would become a trilogy of works on
[[everyday life]], *Critique de la vie quotidienne* was published in 1947, the second and third
instalments appearing in 1962 and 1981 respectively. Translation into
English (as *Critique of Everyday Life*) followed a decade later.
Lefebvre takes the view in these works that a radical politics
interested in change must commence with a thoroughgoing knowledge of the
day-to-day routines and rituals of everyday people. This for Lefebvre is
the true meaning of critique, which he designated as 'revolutionary' in
opposition to what he saw as the useless 'poetic' critiques of the
Surrealists. The critique of everyday life initiated by Lefebvre had two
strategic goals: on the one hand he wanted to convince fellow Marxists
of the utility of the concept of
[[alienation]] for the
analysis of
[[superstructure]]; on the
other hand he wanted to convince philosophers of the importance of the
mundane.
These strategic aims would also underpin what is undoubtedly Lefebvre's
most influential work: *La Production de l'espace* (1974), translated as
*The Production of Space* (1991). Importantly, Lefebvre's work on space
is, as was his work on everyday life, concerned with 'moments', that is
to say, he doesn't forsake time in favour of space, but rather tries to
see how one can think these two dimensions together to produce a
critical account of contemporary life. His final book, *Éléments de
rythmanalyse: Introduction à la connaissance de rythmes* (1992),
translated as *Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time and Everyday Life* (2004),
would make this connection more concrete and offer an explicit
methodology for its analysis. But having said that, Lefebvre also showed
that space and time, in their abstract form, were not by themselves
sufficient to articulate space fully. So he developed a range of
supplementary dimensions to enable history, movement, and change to be
incorporated into our understanding of space.
Lefebvre's work has cast a long shadow, particularly in contemporary
[[Cultural Studies]] (broadly
understood). The three theorists most influenced by Lefebvre are
[[Jameson, Fredric]], [[Harvey, David]], and [[Soja, Edward]]---in all three cases,
it is Lefebvre's insistence on the significance of urbanization that is
key to the respective conceptualizations of
[[postmodernism]] as a
historical period. It should be noted that although [[Certeau, Michel de]] cites his work as
an influence in writing about the
[[practices]] of everyday
life, the differences between their respective approaches are
significant---Certeau jettisons Lefebvre's commitment to Marx.
Lefebvre's former research assistant, [[Baudrillard, Jean]] also
acknowledges an influence, as is obvious in his work on objects, but
similarly rejects his commitment to Marx.
