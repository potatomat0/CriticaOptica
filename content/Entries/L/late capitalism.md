[[late capitalism]]
**(*Spätkapitalismus*)** A term used in
[[Marxism]] since the 1930s,
but brought into prominence in [[critical theory]] by the work of
economic historian Ernest Mandel with the publication of *Der Spätkapitalismus* (1972), translated as *Late Capitalism* (1975). By
late capitalism Mandel meant simply the latest or most current stage of
capitalism's development, namely the transformations that had taken
place in the capitalist [[mode of production]] since the end of
World War II, particularly the explosive growth experienced in the USA,
Germany, and Japan. [[Jameson, Fredric]] adopts this term
and Mandel's analysis in his account of
[[postmodernism]] as the most
appropriate description of the present epoch.
