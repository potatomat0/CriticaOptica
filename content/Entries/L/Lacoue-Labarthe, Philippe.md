[[Lacoue-Labarthe, Philippe]]
(1940--2007) French post-structuralist philosopher. Often working in
collaboration with his Strasbourg colleague [[Nancy, Jean-Luc]], Lacoue-Labarthe is
chiefly concerned in his writing with the metaphysics of the
[[subject]] in the wake of
[[post-structuralism]]. He
explores this problematic by investigating the relationship between
literature and philosophy, or more rigorously put between aesthetics and
politics. In this regard, his work is sometimes seen as a form of
[[deconstruction]], but
although he was close to [[Derrida, Jacques]] he was neither his
student nor his acolyte. He is perhaps best known for his engagement
with the issue of
[[Heidegger, Martin]]'s Nazism and
its implication for philosophy, *La Fiction du politique* (1987),
translated as *Heidegger, Art and Politics* (1990). His previous work
can be seen as the clearing of a path to this particular summit. In a
book co-written with Nancy, he traced the trajectory of German
Romanticism and connected it to Nazism in *L'Absolu littéraire* (1978),
translated as *The Literary Absolute* (1988), and then worked directly
on one of the poets Heidegger was interested in, namely Paul Celan, in
*La Poésie comme experience* (1986), translated as *Poetry as
Experience* (1999). He did not simply condemn Heidegger's philosophy out
of hand, as many have, but argued instead that his philosophy contained
pathways to a philosophical confrontation with Nazism that he failed to
take. He did, however, condemn Heidegger for his silence on the
Holocaust.
