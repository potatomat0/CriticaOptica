[[logocentrism]]

 French
philosopher [[Derrida, Jacques]]'s term, now widely
used, for what he sees as a pervasive form of idealism in language
philosophy which assumes that neither speech nor writing can be thought
without first of all presupposing an abstract and idealized notion of
language which actual speech and writing imperfectly represent. Derived
from the Greek word 'logos' meaning 'word' in the sense of the word of
God or some other authority, logocentrism names a tendency in philosophy
to suppose that there must be some kind of ultimate authority
guaranteeing the meaning of language. When [[Barthes, Roland]] writes of the
[[death of the author]], it
is precisely the death of *this* logocentric notion of language that he
is referring to. In the little collection of interviews, *Positions*
(1972), translated as *Positions* (1981), Derrida states that
logocentrism is the principal focus of the reading strategy he
developed, namely
[[deconstruction]], for which
he is best known. For Derrida, particularly in his earlier work, the
most pernicious symptom of logocentrism is the widespread privileging of
speech over writing in philosophy, usually taking the form of the
assumption that writing is secondary or parasitical to speech.
[[longue dur√©e]] A term that
literally means 'long duration' introduced by the French historian
[[Braudel, Fernand]]. It is a
standard term of reference in the work of the [[Annales School]], which Braudel helped
to establish. It is used to indicate a perspective on history that
extends further into the past than both human memory and the
archaeological record so as to incorporate climatology, demography,
geology, and oceanology, and chart the effects of events that occur so
slowly as to be imperceptible to those who experience them, such as the
changing nature of the planet or the steady increase in population in a
particular area.
