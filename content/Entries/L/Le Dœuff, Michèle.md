[[Le Dœuff, Michèle]]
 (1948--)


French feminist philosopher and playwright. A less well-known member of
the small group of thinkers collectively known as French Feminists, Le
Dœuff's work is more exclusively philosophical than her better-known
peers [[Irigaray, Luce]] and
[[Kristeva, Julia]]. She is
best known for the collection of essays *Recherches sur l'imaginaire
philosophique* (1980), translated as *The Philosophical Imaginary*
(1990), which according to her most important commentator Elizabeth
Grosz comprises her key project. The concept of the imaginary Le Dœuff
proposes should not be confused with [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s concept of the
same name. Grosz identifies three separate components to Le Dœuff's
concept: it refers in a loose sense to imagery (texts), to the image
(the opposite of the rigorous concept), and
[[psychoanalysis]]
([[Freud, Anna]] rather than
Lacanian), specifically the repressed. A specialist in early modern
English thought, she has written on Francis Bacon, Thomas More, and
William Shakespeare.
