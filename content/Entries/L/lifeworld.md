[[lifeworld]]
**(*Lebenswelt*)** The context in which any given consciousness is
inevitably immersed, even if it is incapable of registering it directly.
Although it is intended to describe a kind of background to
consciousness, it should not be thought of as inert; it is rather a
constantly shifting and changing horizon in which consciousness is
enveloped. In this regard, the lifeworld is both subjective and
intersubjective. [[Husserl, Edmund]] introduced this
concept in his late work, *Die Krisis der europäischen Wissenschaften
und die transzendentale Phänomenologie: Eine Einleitung in die
phänomenologische Philosophie* (1936), translated as *The Crisis of
European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology: An Introduction to
Phenomenological Philosophy* (1970). The concept was further developed
by [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]]
and Alfred Schütz, among others in the field of
[[phenomenology]]. In
[[critical theory]],
lifeworld is central to the work of [[Habermas, Jürgen]], who incorporates
it into his theory of [[communicative action]] as a kind of minimum
level of linguistic consciousness. Used in a less technical way, the
concept of lifeworld has also featured in studies of [[everyday life]] as a code word for the
human environment.
