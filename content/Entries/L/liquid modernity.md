[[liquid modernity]] 

[[Bauman, Zygmunt]]

's term for the
present historical condition of globalized capitalism. It is defined by
a chronic weakening of the relationship between labour and capital and
the unleashing of capital's power to dissolve social and communal bonds.
It is characterized by the pervasiveness in contemporary society of what
Bauman refers to as the 'unholy trinity' of uncertainty, insecurity and
unsafety, or as he more bluntly puts it the failure of government to act
as the principal guarantor of existence. *See also*
[[modernity]];
[[postmodernism]].

[[literaturnost]]
(literariness) The principal object of interest for [[Russian Formalism]], the elusive
quality of language use that distinguishes the poetic from the ordinary.
This quality is best seen in---indeed, is produced by---what the Russian
Formalists referred to as
[[ostranenie]], the process
of making the already familiar seem unfamiliar or strange, thereby
awakening in us a heightened state of perception. Just as people who
live by the sea no longer hear the waves, Victor Shklovsky wrote, we no
longer hear the words we utter, and as a consequence perception has
withered into mere recognition. It is this habit-dulled state of affairs
that literature, by power of its ability to defamiliarize the familiar,
is supposed to address, according to Russian Formalism. A simple example
of how this might work, which film directors like Jean-Luc Godard and
Quentin Tarantino have both exploited to good effect, is to tell a story
out of order (as Godard famously said, 'a story has to have a beginning,
a middle, and an end, just not necessarily in that order'), thus
challenging the viewer to reconstruct the correct order for themselves.
