[[liminality]]

 A ritual space
or phase of transition in which a person is no longer what they were,
but is not yet what they will be. The liminal is the in-between, the
neither one thing nor the other. The term was coined by anthropologist
Arnold van Gennep in his classic work *The Rites of Passage* (1908),
which describes the variety of rituals performed by so-called primitive
tribes which facilitate the passage of children to adulthood. Victor
Turner develops this concept further in his work *The Ritual Process:
Structure and Anti-Structure* (1969). Radical theatre theorist and
director Richard Schechner explored the possibilities of this concept
with the Performance Group in New York.
