[[linguistic turn]]

 The
recognition in western philosophy that language poses an insurmountable
limit to philosophical thinking because there is no absolute way of
reducing all expressions to their propositional form. Many of the
philosophers who adhere to this position began their careers as
[[analytic philosophy]],
determined to prove the opposite. The most famous example is [[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]]. The extreme
form of this position, usually attributed to [[Derrida, Jacques]], though it is a
caricature of his thought, is that language is all that there is,
meaning that language is our only means of knowing and engaging the
world. The influence of this line of thinking was felt outside of
philosophy as well. For example, American historian [[White, Hayden]] foregrounds the role
language plays both in the formation of the historical record and the
subsequent construction of historical narrative; [[Geertz, Clifford]] makes a similar
case for anthropology.
