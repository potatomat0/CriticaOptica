[[Laclau, Ernesto]]
(1935--2014) Argentine sociologist and political theorist known for his
extensive work on the concepts of popular struggle and
[[hegemony]]. Born in Buenos
Aires, he was educated at the University of Buenos Aires and completed a
DPhil at Oxford under the supervision of [[Hobsbawm, Eric]]. As a student in
Argentina, he was an active member of the National Party of the
Independent Left, founded by Jorge Abelardo Ramos, and opposed the
Onganía dictatorship. Almost alone among his peers on the Argentinian
Left he was a supporter of Perón---he later said it was Perón that led
him to become interested in
[[anarchism]] and the concept
of [[hegemony]]. Although his
formal training was in history, from 1973 until his death he taught in
the Department of Government at the University of Essex, and it was as a
political thinker that he became renowned. His first major book,
*Politics and Ideology in Marxist Theory* (1977), was a critique of
Latin American [[dependency theory]]. It drew, not
uncritically, on the work of the French Marxist [[Althusser, Louis]]. [[Hall, Stuart]] cited it as an
important influence on his own thinking about class and politics.
He is best known for the book he co-authored with the Belgian
philosopher Chantal Mouffe, *Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a
Radical Democratic Politics* (1985). Adopting a
[[post-structuralism]]
stance, the authors critiqued
[[Marxism]] and
[[Marxism]] for being both
essentialist and determinist, and argue instead that political thinking
needs to grapple with the uncertainty and undecidability of contemporary
existence. Against standard positions in Marxism, they argued that
[[ideology]] does not
necessarily correspond to a particular class and economic development
does not necessarily lead to socialism. In this and subsequent works,
particularly in *On Populist Reason* (2005), Laclau rejected the notion
that [[class]] by itself
brings about the necessary level of group cohesion to effect political
change; similarly, he rejected the notion that group cohesion can only
take place along prescribed lines of class and social identification.
Hegemony was the concept chosen to problematize and rethink political
identity and political commitment. In Laclau's view, hegemony is the
possibility inherent in politics of one group to represent its interests
and world view as synonymous with the general interest.
Laclau and Mouffe argue that politics is essentially a discursive
struggle for the control of meaning and, more particularly, the struggle
to construct one's own position and the position of the Other. On this
view, politics is seen as a 'war of position' rather than a 'war of
movement' (Gramsci's terms for politics that either resists the dominant
political power or seeks to overthrow it). Laclau's later focus on
populism and what he called radical democracy is an extension of this
position. As influential as this book became, it was not without its
critics. [[Anderson, Perry]]
taxes Laclau in *The H-Word: The Peripeteia of Hegemony* (2017) for
creating a deracinated vision of politics in which the contingency of
populist solidarities is overemphasized. However, it is precisely this
contingency, and the sense of hope that change can come from anywhere it
engenders, that attracted Laclau's most high-profile supporter,
Podemos's political strategist Íñigo Errejón.
