[[language games]]

 A use of
language which has its own internal rule system or sense regime. Most
often language games take the form of a conscious mutation of an already
existing language, such as the children's language Pig Latin, but it may
also consist of entirely new words, such as one finds in certain highly
technical jargons. Viennese philosopher [[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]] conceived the
notion of language games to explain the origin of language as an
arbitrary and game-like association between certain sounds and
particular objects and actions. French philosopher [[Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois]] uses the notion of
language games to describe the conditions under which a
[[differend]] may arise: if
the notion of a wrong in one language game, that of the victim, cannot
be translated into the language game of another, say that of the courts,
then it is impossible for that wrong to be heard. The proliferation of
language games and the corresponding impossibility of an authentic
politics is for Lyotard one of the characteristics of
[[postmodernism]].
[[langue]] and *parole* A
binary pair introduced by [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] distinguishing
between, on the one hand, the set of possible ways of making meaning
contained by any one language and, on the other hand, its various
specific, concrete instantiations. In learning another language, our
primary goal must be to gain an appreciation of its *langue* because
only then will we be able to make sense of it, which for Saussure would
mean being able to manipulate it and create new meanings. If we simply
build up a vocabulary of foreign words we will never understand a
language in the way a native speaker of that particular language does
because we lack an appreciation of the rules of combination of those
words that comprise that language's *langue*. The terms are generally
left in the original French because of the difficulty of their
translation; where they are translated they are rendered as 'language'
and 'speech' which is misleading to the extent that it obscures the fact
that for Saussure *langue* refers to the internal structure of a
language, not language itself, for which he used the term *langage*. For
Saussure, *langue* is the system or machine of language developed in the
collective unconscious of a specific community of language users. In
contrast, *parole* is the event of language. This distinction is one of
the cornerstones of
[[structuralism]].
