[[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]]
(1908--2009) French anthropologist and key proponent of
[[structuralism]]. He was
born in Brussels, but his family moved to France when he was 6. He went
to the Lycée Condorcet in Paris, but elected not to take the entrance
exam to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure and instead studied law
and philosophy at the University of Paris, graduating in 1932. In 1929
he began teacher training at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly, along with
[[Beauvoir, Simone de]] and
[[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]]. On
graduation, he taught philosophy without enthusiasm until 1935 when, at
the suggestion of Céléstin Bouglé, he relocated to Brazil to take up a
position as visiting Professor of Sociology as part of a French cultural
mission. Based at the University of São Paulo, Lévi-Strauss used his
time in Brazil to do ethnographic fieldwork among the indigenous peoples
of the Amazon basin and the Mato Grosso. He lived briefly among the
Caduveo, Nambikwara, Tupi-Kawahib, and Bororo peoples, collecting
information about their kinship structures, belief systems, and
religious symbols. A first-hand account of his experiences in Brazil
(including his post-war return visit), which by his own estimation
transformed him into an anthropologist, can be found in *Tristes Tropiques* (1955), translated as *Tristes Tropiques* (1974), which was
an international bestseller.
When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Lévi-Strauss felt duty-bound to
return to France, which he duly did. He was assigned to a liaison
position on the Maginot line. When France surrendered he resumed
teaching at a Lycée in Montpellier, but because of his Jewish ancestry
he was forced to resign because of the race laws imposed by the Nazis.
In 1941, he was fortunate enough to be offered a post at the New School
for Social Research in New York and gain both an admission to the US and
exit from France (others in the same situation, such as [[Benjamin, Walter]], were not so
lucky). Lévi-Strauss made several important connections while in New
York, which were to prove highly influential on his research. Perhaps
most important of all, he met the similarly exiled Russian linguist
[[Jakobson, Roman]],
considered by many to be (along with Lévi-Strauss himself) one of the
founding figures of structuralism. He also met the great American
anthropologist Franz Boas who, in a strange twist of fate, died in
Lévi-Strauss's arms after suffering a heart attack during a dinner at
the Faculty House at Columbia University.
From 1946--7 Lévi-Strauss worked as a cultural attaché at the French
Embassy in Washington DC. He at last returned to Paris in 1948,
initially to a job as associate director of the Musée de l'Homme. In the
same year, he submitted his minor and major theses, respectively: 'La
Vie familiale et sociale des indiens Nambikwara' ('The Family and Social
Life of the Nambikwara Indians') and 'Les Structures élémentaires de la
parenté' ('The Elementary Structures of Kinship'). The latter was
published in 1949, it was translated into English in 1967, but the
translation was so controversial it was retranslated in 1990. Simone de
Beauvoir famously read a draft copy of it and pronounced it a 'brilliant
awakening' of sociology in a long review in [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s journal *Les Temps modernes*. She even claimed to perceive in it a profound
compatibility with the
[[existentialism]] project, a
claim Lévi-Strauss himself laid to rest in *La Pensée sauvage* (1962),
translated as *The Savage Mind* (1966). In 1950 Lévi-Strauss was
appointed to a professorship at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, a
position he retained until his elevation to the Collège de France in
1959.
It was, however, the publication in 1955 of the short essay 'The
Structural Study of Myth' which transformed Lévi-Strauss from obscure
anthropologist to paradigm-changing intellectual. Republished in the
first volume of *Anthropologie Structurale* (1958), translated as
*Structural Anthropology* (1963), this essay was one of the inaugural
works of the analytic method that would come to be known as
structuralism. Utilizing the insights of his friend Jakobson, as well as
the work of Nikolai Troubetzkoy, Lévi-Strauss reasoned that
[[myth]] could be treated
'like a language', i.e. as a complex system of relations between a
variety of different types of elements. Languages may vary widely in
terms of grammar and vocabulary, but they have in common the fact of
grammar and vocabulary. Understanding this is the basic point of
structuralism.
From this point of view, which departs radically from the accepted
anthropological practice of only going with what can be empirically
shown, it isn't the specific content of a myth that is important, but
the set of relations it contains between myth elements, which for
Lévi-Strauss are recurrent across time and space. Using this method,
Lévi-Strauss is able to show that versions of the Oedipal myth can be
found in practically every culture. His question, then, is why do
cultures need myths? His answer, simplified a great deal, is that myths
provide symbolic solutions to real problems; myths are a culture's way
of resolving the contradictions inherent in its own rules. This thesis
has been adopted by [[Jameson, Fredric]] in *Signatures of
the Visible* (1992) to analyse contemporary culture.
At the peak of his fame in 1966, Lévi-Strauss was invited to a
conference at Johns Hopkins University, to which was also invited the
relatively unknown young philosopher [[Derrida, Jacques]], who offered a
devastating critique of Lévi-Strauss and it is now legend that on that
day [[post-structuralism]]
was born. Devastating though the critique was, Lévi-Strauss's career did
not come to an end, though his influence did decline. He nevertheless
continued to publish prolifically for the next three decades, putting
out several more books enlarging upon the ideas laid down in *Structural Anthropology*.
