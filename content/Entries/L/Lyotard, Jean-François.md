[[Lyotard, Jean-François]]
(1924--98) French philosopher, author of more than twenty-five books on
diverse topics, including aesthetics (especially the
[[avant-garde]]), ethics,
justice, and political theory, but undoubtedly best known for his work
on [[postmodernism]], *La Condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir* (1979), translated as *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge* (1984).
In the early part of his career, from 1954--64, Lyotard was actively
involved with the group 'Socialisme ou Barbarie' (Socialism or
Barbarism), whose membership included Jean Laplanche, Claude Lefort, and
[[Genette, Gérard]]. Led by
its founder [[Castoriadis, Cornelius]], Socialisme ou
Barbarie sought to critique
[[Marxism]] from within,
arguing that it was more important to hold to the revolutionary spirit
of Marx's ideas than the exact letter of his writings. In this period,
Lyotard also actively campaigned against France's involvement in
Algeria. Although he parted with the group in 1964, Lyotard remained in
solidarity with the Left until the failure (as he saw it) of the events
of [[May ’68]] led him to
break with Marxism altogether. He would come to see Marxism as a
discourse of terror, as the vituperative account of the 'desire called
Marx' in *Économie libidinale* (1974), translated as *Libidinal Economy*
(1993) makes clear.
Written for the provincial government of Quebec's Conseil des
Universités, *La Condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir* (1979)
lifted the term
[[postmodernism]] out of its
relative obscurity as the name for a new stylistic trend in
architecture, literature, and the arts, and transformed it into an
indictment of the present age. Lyotard's principal thesis, summed up in
the famous phrase that the present age is defined by 'incredulity
towards [[grand narrative]]', is that
scientific discourse (knowledge in general) has entered a new phase
characterized by the unavailability of its traditional legitimating
narratives, namely Revolution (the idea that detecting faults in a
particular society will spontaneously give rise to a social movement to
correct them) and
[[Enlightenment]] (the idea
that through the sophistication of arts and sciences human society
necessarily becomes more humane than it was). In the absence of grand
narratives, knowledge today is forced to fall back on highly localized
values, or 'little narratives', particularly the idea of efficiency.
Perhaps Lyotard's most provocative idea is that these little narratives
should be thought of as highly specific and completely incommensurable
[[language games]] (a term he
borrows from
[[intensity]]). Although
Lyotard took care to state that this did not mean that society is in a
state of chaotic Brownian motion, nor that language games are the only
form of social relation there is, he nonetheless conveyed the strong
impression that the absolute relativism (or
[[anti-foundationalism]])
such a thesis implies should be regarded as a virtue because it means no
single language game is capable of either dominating or integrating all
the other language games. Lyotard goes so far as to say that political
struggle should consist in 'waging war on totality', by which he means
any form of [[hegemony]]
discourse. As meagre a notion of freedom as this is, many readers of
Lyotard have seen it as hopeful because it seems to betoken the idea
that [[resistance]] is
possible. It is, however, a highly problematic notion of resistance
because by definition it lacks any possibility of coordinating
individual language games so as to create a genuine [[social movement]].
Lyotard never pursued the social implications of his thesis at any great
length, although in subsequent works he would argue that it is the
incommensurability between language games---the inability of one
language game to communicate fully with another---that is the source of
what can properly be called injustice. This problematic is a central
preoccupation for Lyotard in the latter part of his career and gave rise
to what is for many his most important philosophical work, namely *Le Différend* (1983), translated as *The Differend: Phrases in Dispute*
(1988). A [[differend]]
(which might be loosely translated as a 'wrong' or 'injustice') arises
when a conflict occurs in such a way that the wronged party is unable to
find the means of representing their position. Lyotard uses as his case
example the extreme relativist position adopted by Holocaust denier
Robert Faurisson in which the only person who can testify to the
existence of gas chambers is somebody who actually died in one.
Lyotard's last works concentrated on this question of representability.
In works such as *L'inhumain* (1988), translated as *The Inhuman:
Reflections on Time* (1991), Lyotard develops an aesthetic around the
idea that only what is unrepresentable is the proper subject for art.
Accepting that this is a logical impossibility, but arguing that it is
nonetheless an aesthetic and indeed epistemological necessity, Lyotard
praises postmodernist art for 'bringing forth' the unrepresentable, at
least in the minds of the beholder, seeing in this a source of hope for
future politics.
