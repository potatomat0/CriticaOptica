[[Löwenthal, Leo]] 
(1900--93)


German sociologist of literature and original member of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Born in Frankfurt am
Main to a middle-class Jewish family, he met future Frankfurt School
colleagues [[Adorno, Theodor]]
and [[Kracauer, Siegfried]]
while still in high school. He studied literature at universities in
Frankfurt, Heidelberg, and Giessen and received a doctorate in
philosophy in 1923. He became an assistant at the Institute for Social
Research under the leadership of [[Horkheimer, Max]] and was given
responsibility for editing the Institute's journal, *Zeitschrift für
Sozialforschung* (Journal for Social Research), a task he continued even
as the journal's base was switched to Paris and then New York. Along
with virtually all the other members of the Frankfurt School, Löwenthal
relocated to the US to escape persecution by the Nazis. But he did not
move with them to California. He instead took up an administrative job
in Washington DC for the duration of the war. Neither did he return to
Germany as Adorno and Horkheimer did, but like [[Marcuse, Herbert]] he stayed on in
the US, taking jobs at Stanford and Berkeley. Although an integral
member of the inner core of the Frankfurt School he is not remembered as
one of its key innovators. His significance as a scholar stems rather
from his extensive analyses of popular literature, which might be read
as practical examples of the kind of analyses his colleagues Adorno and
others were attempting to theorize in their own more abstract way.
