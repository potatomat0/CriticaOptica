[[Lakatos, Imre]] 
(1922--74)


Hungarian philosopher of science and mathematics best known for his
fallibility thesis. Born in Debrecen, Hungary's second largest city, to
a Jewish family, Imre Lipschitz (as he was originally named) studied
philosophy, mathematics, and physics. When the Nazis invaded, he changed
his name to Molnár to disguise his Jewish descent. After the war, he
changed his name to Lakatos to honour General Géza Lakatos who overthrew
the Nazi puppet government in Hungary in 1944 and halted the deportation
of Jews to death camps. He worked as a public servant in the Education
Department while he worked on his PhD, which he completed in 1948. He
then went to Moscow University to continue his studies, but on his
return to Hungary in 1950 he was imprisoned for three years on charges
of revisionism. He left Hungary for good when the Soviet Union invaded
in 1956 and moved to the UK. He completed a PhD at Cambridge, which was
published posthumously as *Proofs and Refutations* (1976), and then took
a post at the London School of Economics in the newly formed philosophy
department headed by [[Popper, Karl]]. *Proofs and
Refutations* attempts to reconcile what Lakatos saw as a rift between
Popper's falsification model of scientific progress and [[Kuhn, Thomas Samuel]]'s paradigm change
model; for Popper, change in scientific thought should occur as soon as
it is discovered that a theory is in part or in whole false, whereas
Kuhn argued that scientists frequently cling to theories even when their
imperfections are known. His solution, later heavily criticized by his
colleague and friend [[Feyerabend, Paul]], was to
describe scientific theories as 'research programmes' and treat them as
provisional (not to say *ad hoc*) attempts to search for truth. Research
programmes can then be evaluated in terms of whether they are
progressive or not.
