[[logical positivism]]

 A school
of philosophy originating in fin-de-si√®cle Vienna with the work of the
so-called [[Vienna Circle]]
founded by Moritz Schlick and Hans Hahn. Its principal theoreticians
were A. J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, Ernst Mach, and [[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]]. Its aim was
to create a new kind of philosophy informed by the principles of science
and logic. By doing so it hoped to demonstrate the irrelevance (and
indeed the wrong-headedness) of
[[metaphysics]], and the
synthetic thinking of post-Kantian thought. It applied a verification
principle to all statements about the world and rejected all those that
could not be verified as true. For example, the statement 'the universe
is infinite' cannot be verified because neither universe as such nor the
idea of infinity can be verified. Logical positivism has had very little
influence on [[critical theory]]. *See also* [analytic

[[empiricism]].
