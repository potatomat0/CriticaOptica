[[Jameson, Fredric]]
 (1934--)


Marxist literary and cultural critic. He is renowned for his landmark
essay, 'Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'
(1984), which for admirers and detractors alike continues to serve as a
focal point for attempts to define the
[[zeitgeist]] of the latter
part of the twentieth century. Few authors display Jameson's
intellectual range, which encompasses a command of several languages and
an encyclopedic knowledge of works in architecture, art, film, history,
politics, and literature.
Jameson completed his doctorate at Yale in 1959. It was published in
1961 as *Sartre: The Origins of a Style*. Focused on
[[precarity]]'s novels and plays
rather than his philosophical writing, it established a template for
future work by exploring the degree to which an author's style can be
read dialectically as a symptom of their engagement with their political
situation. In essence, as he articulates more directly in the work that
follows, for Jameson all cultural works can be treated as
[[neorealism]] for which the
master text is history itself.
In the succeeding decade, Jameson wrote a series of long essays on key
thinkers of the Left, including
[[postmodern]],
[[chora]],
[[anomie]],
[[Lukács, György]], and
[[race]], which sought
both to make these authors (whose works were not yet translated into
English) more widely known in the Anglophone academy and to examine
critically their usefulness for contemporary cultural politics. These
essays were brought together in *Marxism and Form* (1971), undoubtedly
the most important book on Marxist aesthetics written in the latter half
of the twentieth century. The companion volume, *The Prison-House of
Language* (1972), completed the history of the formation of critical
theory by providing a critical account of [[Russian Formalism]] and
[[structuralism]]. *Marxism and Form* concludes with a long essay entitled 'Towards Dialectical
Criticism' which provides a provisional account of Jameson's method.
Reticent about allowing his work to be turned into something he
disparagingly calls a 'brand', Jameson has held back from developing a
singular method that could be easily emulated.
His method, which he has variously called
[[metacommentary]],
[[transcoding]], and
[[dialectical criticism]],
is, he insists, in a permanent state of incompletion. Allowing that his
method is provisional and subject to change, one can nevertheless
identify a number of its essential coordinates. Dialectical thinking, as
Jameson defines it, is a form in time, i.e. a process with a determinate
shape and nature whose central experience is one of a felt
transformation in which a hitherto naive view gives way to a more
elemental view, one that comes fully to grips with the ugly truth of
things. It is a species of self-consciousness that endeavours to
simultaneously think about an object and observe itself thinking about
that object and thereby bring the process of thinking to completion. A
dialectical thought is one that is aware of its cause. Jameson clarifies
this with the example of a critic engaging with a difficult poem. The
standard procedure would be to try to resolve the difficulty in such a
way as to render the poem's meaning in transparent or plain language,
whereas the dialectical method would consist in asking why the poem
appears difficult in the first place. Almost forty years after the
chapter in *Marxism and Form* appeared, Jameson published a manifesto
(of sorts) on his dialectical method in *The Valences of the Dialectic*
(2009).
In *The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act*
(1981), Jameson further developed this model of investigation and
created the concept of the [[political unconscious]] to name the
'difficult' and apparently uninterpretable element present in all
cultural texts. Highly influential in literary studies and [[Cultural Studies]], the concept of the
political unconscious adapts the psychoanalytic concept of
[[wish-fulfilment]] to
explain the unconscious social and political presuppositions of cultural
works. Jameson's thesis is that cultural texts are symbolic solutions to
real historical problems. They bring into existence in textual form a
vision of society that society itself is incapable of realizing. Textual
analysis, following this logic, tries to reconstruct (or reverse
engineer) the historical sub-text or problematic driving a particular
text by asking how it works. His key exhibit in this regard is the
nineteenth century's obsession with the notion of
[[ressentiment]]
(particularly in the work of [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]] and Joseph
Conrad), which, as he shows, served the ideological purpose of
discrediting all forms of political action.
In 1982, Jameson gave a talk at the Whitney Museum of Contemporary Art
entitled 'Postmodernism and Consumer Society'. In the words of one
commentator, namely [[Anderson, Perry]], it redrew the
map of the whole field of humanities at a single stroke. A revised
version of this talk was published in 1984 in *New Left Review* with the
new title of 'Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'.
It quickly became one of the most discussed and cited articles of the
decade because of the way it sought not only to elucidate the specific
features of
[[postmodernism]], but to
explain their underlying causes as well. Jameson rejects the idea that
we have entered a
[[post-industrial society]] age in
which the internal contradictions of capitalism have at last been
resolved and argues instead (adapting Ernest Mandel's argument in *Der Spätkapitalismus* (1972), translated as *Late Capitalism* (1975) in the
process) that the present should be understood as the age in which
capitalism has finally permeated every aspect of life, including
consciousness itself. Culture, for Jameson, is thus both a response to
and registration of the underlying economic and political forces of the
[[mode of production]]
itself.
An extended working out of the implications of his thesis is presented
in book form in *Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late
Capitalism* (1991). The postmodern situation, Jameson argues, is
conditioned by two historical drivers: (i) the so-called 'Green
Revolution', or the industrialization of Third World agriculture, which
had two powerful effects---on the one hand, it massively increased food
production, thus enhancing food security, but it is also put millions of
peasants out of work, forcing them to move to cities in search of
employment; (ii) the refocusing of the First World economy around
tertiary enterprises (i.e. knowledge and information) rather than
primary and secondary enterprises (i.e. agriculture, mining, and
manufacturing).
These changes took effect in the 1950s, but in Jameson's view it wasn't
until the 1970s that they began to be recorded in the political
unconscious of global culture. Examining a wide range of texts across
all the arts, Jameson identifies five symptoms of the cultural shift
toward full-blown postmodernism---the [[waning of affect]];
[[pastiche]]; [[hysterical sublime]]; [[geopolitical aesthetic]]; and a mutation in
built space interfering with our ability to produce a [[cognitive map]] of our situation. He
took as exemplar of the latter the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles,
which has subsequently become a kind of *locus classicus* of
postmodernism. Jameson's subsequent books, *The Geopolitical Aesthetic*
(1992), *The Seeds of Time* (1994), and *A Singular Modernity* (2002),
extended his discussion of the symptoms of postmodernism by examining in
more detail the problem of what came before postmodernism (i.e.
[[modernism]]) and inquiring
into both its persistence and its continued significance.
In contrast to many Marxist critics, Jameson does not engage in either
doctrinal battles relating to the correct interpretation of Marx's
thought or factionalist battles relating to the political uptakes of
Marx's thought (e.g. Leninism, Maoism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, etc.). For
Jameson, the crucial measure of any form of thought and indeed work of
art is whether or not it enables us to imagine a future different from
our present, even if it is brought about by cataclysm. For this reason,
Jameson has nurtured a lifelong interest in
[[modernism]] and science
fiction, which in his view offer the most important examples of this
type of utopian thinking. He is slowly bringing to completion a long
cycle of books entitled the *Poetics of Social Forms*, consisting of
instalments on utopia (*Archaeologies of the Future* (2005)), modernism
(*The Modernist Papers* (2007)), and its precursor *The Antinomies of Realism* (2013), as well as allegory (*The Ancients and the Postmoderns: On the Historicity of Forms* (2015)). Alongside these works Jameson has also published a series of exercises in dialectical virtuosity: *The Hegel Variations: On the Phenomenology of Spirit* (2010), *Representing Capital: A Reading of Volume One* (2011), and *Raymond Chandler: The Detections of Totality* (2016).
