[[Jung, Carl]] 
(1875--1961)


Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychology whose work on
[[archetype]] and
[[myth]] had a significant
influence on Anglo-American literary criticism in the 1950s and 1960s,
particularly via the work of [[Frye, Northrop]]. Jung's work was less
influential on continental literary criticism, but it did have at least
one significant advocate in France, namely [[Bachelard, Gaston]].
Jung studied for a medical degree at universities in Basel and Zurich,
writing his doctorate on the psychopathology of the occult. Reading
Richard von Krafft-Ebing's work decided him on a career in psychiatry,
then the least respected branch of medicine. He took a resident's
position at Burghölzli Asylum (attached to the University of Zurich)
under the direction of Eugen Bleuler, who coined the term schizophrenia.
During his time at Burghölzli, Jung read and admired the works of
[[Freud, Sigmund]],
particularly *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1953), and in a gesture of
homage he sent a copy of his book on word associations to Freud,
believing it provided empirical support to the latter's theory. Freud
reciprocated the gesture several months later, spawning an intense
friendship which lasted six years. For a time, Freud thought of Jung as
his natural successor, making him the first president of the
International Psychoanalytic Association, but they broke from each other
in 1912 for a variety of personal and professional reasons (they
continued to snipe at one another for the rest of their lives in their
published work). Their main theoretical differences concerned the
concepts of the [[libido]]
and the [[unconscious]]---in
contrast to Freud, Jung conceived the libido as a kind of life-force,
thinking Freud's version overly reductive; while his concept of the
unconscious allowed for an inherited dimension he called the
[[collective unconscious]].
Like Freud, Jung's most important theories were developed out of
self-analysis, particularly of his own childhood recollections of dreams
and events.
Jung's theory of developmental psychology revolves around a fundamental
confrontation between the self, which yearns to be realized (a process
Jung referred to as individuation), and the unconscious, the domain of
the [[archetype]], which
constantly seeks actualization. In contrast to Freud's theory, which
focuses almost exclusively on childhood, and treats the unconscious as
an unknowable other, Jung's theory holds that the unconscious is a
constant presence and the developmental confrontation between self and
unconscious is lifelong. The process of individuation is highly
complicated and by no means linear---the confrontation with the
archetypes, particularly, gives rise to several different types of
response in the psyche. These varying responses are what differentiate
people from one another. Jung argued that people can be classified
according to psychological type, of which there are eight basic
varieties; this concept has been very influential in the development of
management theory.
