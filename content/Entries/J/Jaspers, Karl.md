[[Jaspers, Karl]] 
(1883--1969)


German psychiatrist and philosopher, considered one of the fathers
(along with [[Heidegger, Martin]]) of German
[[existentialism]]. Born in
the northern German town of Oldenburg, Jaspers initially followed his
father's footsteps into law, but soon switched to medicine. He obtained
a doctorate in medicine in 1908 and then took his habilitation in
psychology. He worked briefly as a psychiatrist, but spent the bulk of
his professional life as an academic. However, his earliest publications
were clinical in orientation. His two-volume work, *Allgemeine Psychopathologie* (General Psychopathlogy, 1913) remains an important
reference point today as one of the pioneering works of the so-called
'biographical method' of diagnosis. In the early 1920s, Jaspers shifted
into philosophy and it is as a philosopher that he is best known.
Because his wife was Jewish, Jaspers was removed from his university
post in 1937 by the Nazis. This made for difficult times for the Jaspers
during the war years, but in the aftermath of the war, because he was
untainted by any direct association with the Nazis (in contrast to
Heidegger), he was able to take on a leadership role in rebuilding the
German university system. Jaspers wrote widely, and for a broadly
popular audience, on the question of Germany's future, including the
difficult issue of how it should deal with its guilt. In the years
following the war, Jaspers became a high-profile spokesperson for the
humanist viewpoint. Perhaps because of this, inasmuch as the humanist
perspective became very outmoded in the
[[structuralism]] period
Jaspers's work is quite neglected today.
