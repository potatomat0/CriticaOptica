[[jouissance]]

 The French word
for enjoyment. It has become part of the vocabulary of Anglophone
[[critical theory]] and more
particularly
[[psychoanalysis]] because of
the translations of the work of [[Barthes, Roland]], [[Bataille, Georges]], [[Kristeva, Julia]], and [[Lacan, Jacques]], among others. In
contrast to the English word 'enjoyment', jouissance can also mean
orgasm. Early attempts at translating it as 'bliss', as for instance in
Richard Miller's translation of Barthes's *The Pleasure of the Text*
(1975), lack this dimension, and though it captures something of the
spiritual dimension of the word it still lacks its intensity. Central to
its usage in critical theory is its opposition to '*plaisir*'
([[pleasure]])---pleasure is
usually seen as the opposite of jouissance in that it is seen as a
coming to an end, whereas jouissance is regarded as limitless. The
connection to orgasm is quite ambiguous in this respect because the
implication is that jouissance occurs on a higher plane to that of the
merely physical; it is an orgasm of the mind or spirit not just the
body. The opposition between pleasure and jouissance is modelled on [[Frege, Gottlob]]'s opposition
between *'Lust'* (pleasure) and *'Genuss'* (enjoyment), as discussed by
[[Koj√®ve, Alexandre]]. In
psychoanalysis this opposition is interpreted as a prohibition on
jouissance---the [[pleasure principle]] regards jouissance
as excessive and destabilizing. On this view, pleasure can only be
pleasurable so long as it is not too pleasurable. In contrast,
jouissance can only be jouissance if it goes beyond mere pleasure and
risks death and courts disaster.
