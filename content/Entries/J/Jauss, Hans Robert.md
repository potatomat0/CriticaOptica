[[Jauss, Hans Robert]]
(1921--97) German literary theorist, best known for establishing
[[Reception Aesthetics]].
Together with his colleague [[Iser, Wolfgang]], he is the founder of
the Konstanz School, which has had a significant influence on
Anglo-American [[reader-response criticism]]. Born in
Göppingen, Jauss studied in Esslingen and Geislingen. In 1939 he joined
the army and saw service on the Russian Front. He was briefly imprisoned
at the end of the war as an enemy combatant, thus delaying his
university studies until 1948. He completed his undergraduate and
postgraduate degrees at the University of Heidelberg, graduating in 1957
with a dissertation on Marcel Proust. Between 1959 and 1966, Jauss held
jobs in Münster and Giessen. In 1966, he was invited to join the newly
established University of Konstanz to set up the subject area of
literary studies. He did this in collaboration with several colleagues
and the end result became known as the Konstanz School. Jauss's own
inaugural lecture in 1967, entitled 'Literary History as a Challenge to
Literary Theory', was seminal in launching what he describes as
Reception Aesthetics, which is a mode of literary history interested in
the interaction between readers and writers. His most important works
include: *Toward an Aesthetic of Reception* (1982) and *Aesthetic Experience and Literary Hermeneutics* (1982).
[[Jetztzeit]] **(now-time)**
[[Benjamin, Walter]] uses this
term in his 'Theses on the Philosophy of History' to describe a notion
of time that is ripe with revolutionary possibility, time that has been
detached from the continuum of history. It is time at a standstill,
poised, filled with energy, and ready to take what Benjamin called the
'tiger's leap' into the future. It isn't naturally occurring, however,
and takes the intervention of the artist or revolutionary to produce it
by 'blasting' it free from the ceaseless flow in which it would
otherwise be trapped. Benjamin contrasts *Jetztzeit* with the
'homogeneous empty time' of the ruling class, which is history written
from the perspective of the victors (as [[Anderson, Benedict]] shows in his
account of nation as [[imagined community]]).
