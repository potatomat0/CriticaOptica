[[James, C. L. R.]] 
(1901--89)


Trinidadian Marxist historian. He was born in the West Indies and spent
his early life there. His father was a cricketer and James too developed
a passion for the game, a fact that would later be reflected in his
writing. He moved to the UK in his early thirties, which brought him
into contact British Trotskyism, a movement in which he would come to
play a leading role. In 1938 he published the work for which he is best
known, *Black Jacobins* (1938), a Marxist history of the 1791 slave
revolt in Santo Domingo (Haiti) led by Toussaint L'Ouverture, in which
he argues---rather provocatively---that the only reason the British
supported the abolitionist movement to end slavery was because it would
cause economic harm to the French, their main geopolitical rival both in
Europe and in the scramble for colonial possessions. In the same year,
James travelled to the US on a speaking tour and from there to Mexico,
where he met the exiled Trotsky. In the 1940s and 1950s James's work
focused on developing a Marxist critique of Stalinism, which he saw as
largely incompatible with the core tenets of Marxism because, like
capitalism, it centred on the control of labour. In *Notes on
Dialectics* (1948) he argued that what mattered most to Marxism was the
freedom of the proletariat and that too many commentators on
[[Marxism]]'s thought overlooked
this. At the close of the 1950s, in *Facing Reality* (1958), James
offered something of a precursor to
[[fort/da]] and
[[drive]]'s concept of the
[[multitude]]: he argued that
a new socialist society already existed and was ready to emerge in the
official capitalist society. His view was that the long-awaited
socialist revolution that was central to all Marxist thinking at the
time would only occur if allowed to do so spontaneously and without the
rigmarole of councils and organizing bodies. He held up as proof of this
line of thought the 1956 Hungarian uprising. *Facing Reality* also
contained strong anti-imperialist statements from James---it praised the
work of Ghandi, Mao, and Nkrumah. He saw the collapse of imperialism as
a precursor to the collapse of capitalism. Like
[[androgyny]], James favoured
policies that benefited the population as a whole, rather than the
political and cultural elite. He did not favour the use of violence in
pursuit of national liberation, but neither did he rule out its
necessity given the willingness of colonial powers to use violence to
maintain power. In 1963 James published a book that was part memoir but
mostly social history, entitled *Beyond a Boundary*, about the sport of
cricket. At the time it was considered somewhat quirky subject matter
for a Marxist historian, but it has proven to be one of the most
important cultural analyses of sports and deservedly one of James's most
well-regarded publications.
