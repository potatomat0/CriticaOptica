[[Jarry, Alfred]] 
(1873--1907)


French novelist and playwright who influenced
[[Surrealism]] and
[[Dada]], but also the
[[Situationism]] and the
[[OULIPO]] authors who were
attracted to his concept of
[[’pataphysics]], or the
science of imaginary solutions. A conspicuously eccentric figure, Jarry
is best remembered for his play *Ubu Roi* (King Ubu, 1896) which caused
such a scandal on its opening night, largely because of the swearing it
contained. It wasn't staged again for more than a decade. It has since
become a cornerstone of the
[[Absurdism]] theatre canon.
His late novel, *Le Surmâle* (1902), translated as *The Supermale*
(1964), is an inspiration for [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and Félix
Guattari's concept of the
[[desiring-machine]].
