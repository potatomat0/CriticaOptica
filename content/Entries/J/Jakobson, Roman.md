[[Jakobson, Roman]]
(1896--1982) Russian linguist, formative member of both the [[Russian Formalism]] (the [[Moscow Linguistic Circle]] as well as
[[Opoyaz]]) and the [[Prague Linguistic Circle]], and one
of the founding fathers of
[[structuralism]]. An
incredibly prolific author---he wrote over 600 articles---Jakobson is
widely regarded as the pre-eminent linguist of the twentieth century.
Born in Moscow, he studied historical philology at Moscow University. He
was, by then, already friends with the greatest poets and painters of
his time, including the futurist poets Velimir Khlebnikov and Vladimir
Mayakovsky as well as the great revolutionary artist Cazimir Malevich.
In 1915, Jakobson helped establish the Moscow Linguistic Circle (the
first meeting took place in his parent's dining room), with the purpose
of promoting a linguistic approach to poetics. Its membership included
such key figures as Victor Shklovsky and Yuri Tynyanov. Around the same
time he met Nicolai Troubetzkoy, who shared his interest in
[[neurosis]]'s
[[phenomenology]] and with
whom he would form a fast friendship that proved highly influential on
his thinking. Although Russia was in a real state of political turmoil
at the time, in 1917 Jakobson took part in the creation of *Opoyaz*, a
St Petersburg-based society for the study of poetic language and the
group mostly responsible for what we think of as Russian Formalism
today.
Jakobson chose to leave Russia in 1920, which proved a wise decision as
many of his former colleagues who remained behind were eliminated by the
new Bolshevik regime. Initially he went to Prague, where he worked as a
translator for the Soviet Red Cross mission, then as a cultural attaché.
Legend has it that structuralist linguistics was born in Prague because
Jakobson realized, while listening to Russian poetry translated into
Czech, that while their words were similar on paper they were quite
different sounding and therefore had a dissimilar musicality. Jakobson
thus began to concentrate on sound, an approach that led him to focus
his research on the notion of the phoneme (a unit of sound meaning). It
was in Prague too that Jakobson first read the work of
[[suture]], realizing
straightaway the importance of the distinction between [[contrapuntal reading]]. After nearly a
decade in the city, Jakobson established the Prague Linguistic Circle,
again with the intention of focusing on poetic language. Its early
membership included René Wellek and Jan Mukařovský.
The threat of war interrupted the Circle's work in 1938 when in defiance
of world opinion Germany absorbed large sections of Czechoslovakia into
the Third Reich. Jakobson fled, first to Denmark, where he collaborated
with the other great linguist of his generation [[Hjelmslev, Louis]], and then like
so many other European exiles to New York, where he met [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]]. He remained
in the US for the rest of his life, holding posts at the New School for
Social Research, Harvard, and
[[ANT]]
(Massachusetts
Institute of Technology). Aside from the countless incidental analyses
Jakobson produced, his major mark on critical theory was his problematic
but nonetheless striking assertion that poetic language is autonomous,
meaning that while it may be constructed from ordinary language there is
something distinctive about it that makes it stand apart. Jakobson
called this difference
[[literaturnost]]
(literariness), a code phrase that together with
[[ostranenie]]
(defamiliarization or estrangement) would become synonymous with Russian
Formalism itself.
Jakobson's concept of poetic language is, however, only one part of his
larger model of communication. According to Jakobson, verbal
communication has six constitutive functions: the
[[pastiche]] (it conveys no
meaning, but serves to keep the communication channels open);
referential (that which refers to the speech context); emotive (the
speaker's attitude to their own speech); poetic (the autotelic
dimension, i.e. it has no purpose except itself); conative (the
orientation of the speech toward its addressee); and metalingual (the
reflective dimension which focuses on the properties of language itself,
as for instance when we ask 'what do you mean?'). Jakobson argues that
all six functions are present in all speech, but different functions may
have greater or less prominence according to the occasion.
