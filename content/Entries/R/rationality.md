[[rationality]]

 In philosophy,
the ability to use reason to make decisions regarding possible actions
and determine the optimal choice. Philosophy tends to privilege
rationality over the
[[instinct]], the
passional, and the willed, arguing that it is only by exercising reason
that humans can be free. In some cases, it is argued that rationality
only obtains in mathematics and the physical sciences and that all the
other disciplines are too tainted by irrational elements. Some
philosophers also hold that rationality is unique to humans, but this
view has been seriously challenged in recent times. In contrast, the
[[Frankfurt School]] is
critical of rationality precisely because they see it as inhuman because
it favours the smooth-running of systems (such as the economy) over the
inconsistency of individual humans.
