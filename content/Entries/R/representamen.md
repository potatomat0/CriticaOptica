[[representamen]]

 One of the
three key components of American philosopher [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]]'s tripartite
concept of the [[sign]] (the
other two being the interpretant and the
[[object]]). The
representamen is the image of a sign created in the mind of an observer.
It is in this sense a sign of a sign. However, it cannot be considered
in isolation from the other two components of the sign.
