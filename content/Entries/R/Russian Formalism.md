[[Russian Formalism]]

 One of
the most influential literary critical movements of the twentieth
century. Speaking very generally, Russian Formalism as a critical
movement was interested in identifying the specific quality of language
use that separated the literary text from the non-literary text. Their
approach was scientific inasmuch as they thought it was possible to
establish what it is precisely that distinguishes ordinary usages of
language from the poetic. Unlike the later
[[post-structuralism]], the
Russian Formalists treated poetry as an autonomous form of discourse
that was distinct from all other forms of discourse. They referred to
this difference in qualitative terms as
[[literaturnost]]
(literariness) and sought to quantify (i.e. formalize) it by means of
their theory of
[[ostranenie]]
(estrangement), which simply put is the process of making the already
familiar seem unfamiliar or strange, thereby awakening in us a
heightened state of perception.
Russian Formalism is a generic term that covers the work of at least two
major groups of researchers based in Russia in the early part of the
twentieth century. The first group, based in St Petersburg, was known by
the acronym [[Opoyaz]]
(*Obschevesto po izucheniyu poeticheskogo yazyka* (Society for the Study
of Poetic Language)). Formed in 1916 by a small gathering of students and
professors working in language studies, it was chaired by the poet Osip
Brik. The original membership included [[Shklovsky, Viktor]], Boris
Eichenbaum, and [[Jakobson, Roman]]. The group folded
in 1923, not the least because many of its core members fled into exile
to escape either the First World War or the Russian Revolution or both.
The remnants of this group merged with the second of Russian Formalism's
constitutive groups, namely the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by an
*Opoyaz* exile Roman Jakobson. Established for the purpose of
investigating the poetic function of language, its membership included
such figures as Victor Shklovsky and Yuri Tynyanov, who would both play
a major part in advancing the theoretical development of Russian
Formalism. The group sought to connect poetics and linguistics so as to
show that you could not properly understand one in the absence of the
other.
