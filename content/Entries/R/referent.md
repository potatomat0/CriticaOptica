[[referent]]

 The real object in
the world referred to by a
[[sign]]. The referent of an
image of a tree is an actual tree. The referent should not be confused
with the signified, which is a concept not a thing. Not all signs have a
referent. Indeed, for a great many signs it is simply another sign that
stands in the place of the referent.
