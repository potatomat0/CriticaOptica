[[Reich, Wilhelm]] 
(1897--1957)


Austrian [[psychoanalysis]]
whose combination of
[[Marxism]] and
psychoanalysis influenced a generation of political activists and
writers in Europe and the US. In later life, he became an extremely
controversial figure because of his rather eccentric views. He was
prosecuted by the Food and Drug Administration
([[ANT]]) in the US and died in
prison.
Reich was born in Dobrzanica, which is now in the Ukraine but was then
an outer satellite of the Austro-Hungarian empire. His family were
wealthy farmers (a fact that he would later credit with sparking his
interest in the study of sex), and although of Jewish descent they
disavowed their cultural heritage. Reich was home-schooled by a private
tutor until he was 12, when his mother committed suicide. He was then
sent to a boys' school. After the outbreak of World War I, when the
Russians invaded in 1915 Reich and his brother fled to Vienna, losing
everything. He joined the army in 1915 and served until the end of the
war. He then studied medicine at the University of Vienna, where he met
[[Freud, Sigmund]] who invited
him to join his Psychoanalytic Association while he was still a student.
He set up private practice as an analyst in 1922. Over the next few
years he wrote what is probably his best known and arguably his most
important work, *Die Funktion des Orgasmus: Zur Psychopathologie und zur
Soziologie des Geschlechslebens* (1929), translated as *The Function of
the Orgasm: Sex-Economic Problems of Biological Energy* (1968). It was
this work, perhaps not surprisingly, that caught the attention of
writers like William Burroughs and Norman Mailer who, in their turn,
popularized Reich's work for the counter-culture generation.
In 1930 he moved to Berlin and joined the Communist Party of Germany
(KPD). He was witness to the rise of Nazism in Germany, which he
theorized in *Die Massenpsychologie des Faschismus* (1933), translated
as *The Mass Psychology of Fascism* (1980), by asking the question: why
did the masses turn towards an authoritarian party even though it was
manifestly not in their interest to do so? His somewhat simplistic, but
nevertheless suggestive answer was that sexual suppression in childhood
prepared people for authoritarian rule in later life. Reich was expelled
from the KPD for this book, as a liability to their cause, and when the
Nazis came into power it was immediately banned and he was forced to
flee the country. He moved to Scandinavia, but was forced to move again,
this time to the US, when World War II broke out.
In the US he extended the work begun in Norway, namely his search for
the origins of life. He claimed to discover an observable energy he
called 'orgone', which he said was the source of life itself. Although
his scientific methods and procedures were questioned in his lifetime by
scientists as eminent as Albert Einstein, Reich was unshakeable in his
conviction that he had discovered the beginnings of life itself. He
created 'orgone accumulators' designed to collect and concentrate this
'cosmic' energy so that it could be used to such beneficial ends as
healing the sick. Unfortunately for him, Reich sold 'orgone
accumulators' to mail-order customers and this attracted the attention
of the FDA. An injunction was taken out in 1954 to prevent him from
shipping his apparatuses across state lines, but he refused to comply
with the order. And though he sent the judge presiding over his case
copies of his books, he was found to be in contempt and given a two-year
sentence.
