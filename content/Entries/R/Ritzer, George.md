[[Ritzer, George]]
 (1940--)


American sociologist best known for his
[[McDonaldization]] thesis.
Ritzer was born and raised in New York City and his parents were in his
own words 'upper lower class' Jews: his father drove a taxi and his
mother was a secretary. Ritzer's first degree, from City College of New
York, was in psychology; he followed this up with an MBA from the
University of Michigan. He then took a position in human resources at
Ford, where he worked until 1968, when he completed a PhD in
organizational behaviour from Cornell. He then held jobs at the
Universities of Tulane and Kansas, before being appointed Professor of
Sociology at the University of Maryland in 1974, where he has remained
ever since. Ritzer is a prolific author, but it was his rather
pessimistic thesis that the whole world was steadily being transformed
into a mirror image of McDonald's, which first appeared in *The McDonaldization of Society* (1993), that brought him international
attention and turned him into an academic superstar. He is primarily a
critic of what [[Baudrillard, Jean]] termed
'consumer society', but resists attributing the cause of the changes he
decries to [[late capitalism]] and instead makes
consumption seem like a character flaw.
