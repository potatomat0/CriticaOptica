[[Ricœur, Paul]] 
(1913--2005)


French religious philosopher and hermeneuticist. Born in Valence, Ricœur
was orphaned at two (his father was killed in World War I at the Battle
of the Marne and his mother died shortly after his birth), and raised by
his devoutly Protestant paternal grandparents in Rennes. He completed
his preliminary training at the University of Rennes, having failed the
entrance exam to the illustrious École Normale Supérieure. Graduating in
1935, Ricœur moved to Paris to undertake doctoral work at the Sorbonne.
There, he participated in weekly study sessions at the home of Gabriel
Marcel, who introduced him to
[[existentialism]] philosophy
and theology. He also collaborated with Emmanuel Mounier, founder of the
left-wing Christian journal *Esprit*.
The irruption of World War II interrupted his studies. Ricœur was
drafted into the infantry in 1939 and flung into the fray almost
immediately. His unit was captured by the invading German army in 1940
and he spent the remainder of the war in a prison camp. It was not
especially arduous in the camp, it gave him time to read and think and
there were a number of other intellectuals there with whom he could
converse (indeed the camp was accredited as a degree-granting body by
the Vichy government). He also began his translation of [[Husserl, Edmund]]'s *Ideen 1*
(Ideas 1) there, which he would subsequently submit as his minor thesis.
He also collaborated with Mikel Dufrenne on a study of the German
existentialist [[Jaspers, Karl]], which was
published after the war as *Karl Jaspers et la philosophie de
l'existence* (Karl Jaspers and the philosophy of existence, 1947).
After the war Ricœur taught at the Collège Cévenol until 1948 when he
succeeded Jean Hyppolite as Chair in the History of Philosophy at the
University of Strasbourg. In 1950 he submitted his major thesis,
*Philosophie de la volonté: Le Volontaire et l'involuntaire* (The
Philosophy of the Will: The Voluntary and Involuntary), which would
prove to be the first part of a trilogy. In 1956 he moved to the
Sorbonne, where he remained for a decade before taking up a senior
administrative position in the newly established and so-called
experimental university at Nanterre (among its faculty members were
[[Badiou, Alain]], [[Deleuze, Gilles]], and [[Foucault, Michel]]), but this
experience proved a disappointment. He was assaulted by students during
the events of [[May ’68]] and
derided by them for being out of touch. This was in complete contrast to
his experience in the 1950s when as an outspoken critic of France's war
in Algeria, his students had saved him from internment. Disenchanted
with French academic life, Ricœur left France, first for Belgium and
then definitively to the University of Chicago in the US.
Ricœur is best known for his critique of Freud, *De l'interprétation.
Essai sur Freud* (1965), translated as *Freud and Philosophy: An Essay
on Interpretation* (1970), his study of metaphor, *La métaphore vive*
(1975), translated as *The Rule of Metaphor* (1977), and the immense
three-volume work on narrative, *Temps et Récit* (1983--85), translated
as *Time and Narrative* (1984--88). Always acknowledged as important,
Ricœur's work has never enjoyed fashionability, but in a way that is
precisely what is important about it: he was never taken in completely
by fashionable ways of thinking such as existentialism or
[[structuralism]] and his
work always offered a powerful alternative viewpoint.
