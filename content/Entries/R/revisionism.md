[[revisionism]]

 A general term
that can be used with both positive and negative connotations for any
scholarly practice dedicated to revising an established position. In
[[Marxism]], revisionism is
used in a pejorative sense to describe any deviation from the central
tenets of Marx's thought (e.g. his theory that the transition to
socialism will require a revolution). It is also used by communist
leaders as a general term of political abuse in arguments between
communist countries (e.g. Mao accused Khrushchev of being a revisionist
for his de-Stalinization policies, while Albanian General Secretary
Enver Hoxha accused the Maoists of being revisionists for normalizing
relations with the US). In history, revisionism is generally reserved
for those historians who seek to deny that major historical events such
as genocides actually took place. The so-called Holocaust-deniers are
one example, but there are many others. On a positive note, however,
historians who seek to overturn the bias and exceptionalism of certain
national histories are also known as revisionists, but they plainly
serve an important purpose. In former colonial countries like the
Americas and Australia, revisionist historians have played an crucial
role in challenging popular misconceptions about indigenous peoples.
