[[rhizome]]

 Term adapted from
plant biology by [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] to conceptualize
[[non-linear system]] relations in
both the realm of pure thought and the concrete and the
[[everyday life]]. Appearing for
the first time in a short pamphlet entitled *Rhizome* (1976), which was
subsequently republished as the introduction to *Mille Plateaux* (1980),
translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987), the concept of the rhizome
is presented in binary opposition to what Deleuze and Guattari refer to
as the arboreal or tree-like, by which they mean linear or hierarchical
relations. Arboreal is effectively Deleuze and Guattari's codephrase for
the three main targets of their
[[schizoanalysis]] project:
(i) structuralist linguistics; (ii)
[[transsexual]]
[[Marxism]], or indeed any
determinate form of history; (iii)
[[psychoanalysis]].
The rhizome is Deleuze and Guattari's figure for thinking multiplicity
as a substantive. One arrives at the rhizomatic or the multiple only by
subtracting the power or quality of the unique from the equation
(Deleuze and Guattari use the matheme *n*-1 to express the rhizome). The
standard example of what they mean by this is the notion of the
crowd---a crowd comes into being only when the various individuals that
compose it cease to think of themselves *as* individuals and become part
of the collective entity itself, moving and acting according to its
dictates rather than their own
[[desire]]. For Deleuze and
Guattari, the rhizome is synonymous with the swarm and the pack. Deleuze
and Guattari are clear, however, that no pure form of the rhizome or
indeed the arboreal actually exists; rather, these two forms are best
seen as tendencies present to a greater or lesser degree in all
processes.
Deleuze and Guattari identify six key principles underpinning the
operation of the rhizome: (i) connection---any point of the rhizome can
be connected to anything other, there is no prescribed pathway for
connections; (ii) heterogeneity---the rhizome does not simply connect
signifier to signified, as in
[[structuralism]]
linguistics, but entire semiotic chains to regimes of power and specific
historical circumstances; (iii) multiplicity---the rhizome is always as
complete as it can be; it does not
[[lack]] anything, so there
are no supplementary or hidden dimensions that can be mobilized to
overcode it; (iv) a signifying rupture---the rhizome can be broken at a
certain point, but it will always restart elsewhere (what they mean is
that ideas can mutate, so that even if we break with something as being
fascistic, for example, there is no guarantee that it won't return again
under a different guise); (v) cartography---the rhizome can be mapped,
but not traced or copied  [*calqué* in the original French ] (maps refer
to performance in Deleuze and Guattari's view, whereas tracings refer to
[[competence]]); (vi)
decalcomania---the rhizome can incorporate tracings, meaning any
pre-existing programme of thought, by plugging them into its own
heterogeneous process, thereby changing their function (in other words,
one doesn't necessarily need to reject psychoanalysis outright, its
insights can be used as starting points).
