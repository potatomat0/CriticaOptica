[[reality-testing]]
**(*Realitätsprüfung*)** The process by which we discriminate between
external and internal stimuli, that is to say between perceptions of
actual objects in the world and hallucinations of non-real or virtual
objects. It operates in the conscious part of the psychical apparatus.
It is not, however, foolproof---e.g. someone in the grip of
[[psychosis]] is incapable of
reality-testing.
