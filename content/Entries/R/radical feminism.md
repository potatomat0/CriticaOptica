[[radical feminism]]

 A loosely
formed, but highly visible movement within
[[feminism]] calling for a
substantial change to the structure of contemporary society (hence the
designation 'radical'), which originated in the US in the 1960s with the
Women's Liberation Movement. Radical feminism does not have a single or
unified theoretical or political doctrine, however it does take a
consistent stance towards men. Radical feminists identify
[[patriarchy]] as the
principal and universal cause of women's oppression via its control of
women's reproductive capacity, sexuality and---perhaps most importantly,
though much less obviously---via the ideology of
[[femininity]]. Some radical
feminists, such as [[Firestone, Shulamith]], argue that it
is precisely because of women's reproductive capacity that they are
vulnerable to subordination by men because pregnancy and childrearing
makes them dependent on men for support, at least in humanity's
prehistorical beginnings. Therefore control of reproduction via such
means as the contraceptive pill is seen as a crucial political step.
Similarly the control of women's sexuality is resisted by redefining sex
in such a way that it is no longer seen in terms of satisfying male
desires and needs (as exemplified by pornography and prostitution). One
solution, advocated by at least some radical separatists, is to opt out
of the heterosexual matrix altogether and adopt a lesbian lifestyle. The
more widely adopted solution, which was advocated by the likes of
[[Greer, Germaine]], is for
women to set aside the restrictions of the cultural expectations of
chastity until marriage and self-denial within marriage and actively
pursue their own pleasure needs. Many
[[post-feminism]] have in
recent times written off this strategy as a pyrrhic victory at best,
describing its outcomes as melancholy sex without commitment or love.
Probably the greatest changes, though, have been made with regard to the
ideology of femininity, which radical feminists sought to overturn.
Radical feminism, via the work of people like [[Daly, Mary]], has constructed a
women's epistemology, that is, a way of knowing the world from a
woman-centric perspective.
