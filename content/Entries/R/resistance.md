[[resistance]]

 **1.** Anything
that impedes the work of analysis in
[[psychoanalysis]]. It
manifests in therapy as a reluctance to talk about a particular topic,
or more generally as evasiveness in conversation, thus inhibiting the
flow of free association that
[[Freud, Anna]]'s model of
psychotherapy depends upon. But it does not only refer to an
unwillingness to disclose aspects of one's life to someone else. In
psychoanalysis the most potent form of resistance is to be seen in an
[[analysand]]'s unwillingness
to trust their analyst, which impacts on the process of
[[transference]] that is the
bedrock of the therapeutic encounter. Resistance also manifests in the
reluctance certain analysands express regarding the need to give up on
their symptoms---in this sense it points to an attachment to the symptom
and the [[jouissance]]
derived from that attachment.
**2.** A general term in critical and cultural theory for any
non-violent act of cultural or social defiance of
[[hegemony]] power. The term
is most widely used in [[Cultural Studies]], which---somewhat
over-optimistically, it has to be said---in some cases is prepared to
see even so simple an act as wearing jeans to work or school as
resistive because it defies certain social conventions (now largely
outmoded as a consequence). But this view of what resistance means is
also criticized within Cultural Studies for being naive about the ease
with which such acts of resistance are recuperated by power---in this
case, it simply created a much larger market for jeans than previously
existed. Consequently, resistance is probably better treated as a
[[problematic]] rather than a
social fact: 'what counts as resistance?' is a useful question to ask.
[[ressentiment]] A vengeful,
petty-minded state of being that does not so much want what others have
(although that is partly it) as want others to not have what they have.
The term, which might be translated as 'resentment', though in most
places it is generally left in the original French, is usually
associated with German philosopher [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]], who defined it
as a slave morality. Nietzsche sees *ressentiment* as the core of
Christian and Judaic thought and, consequently, the central facet of
western thought more generally. In this context, *ressentiment* is more
fully defined as the desire to live a pious existence and thereby
position oneself to judge others, apportion blame, and determine
responsibility. Nietzsche did not invent the concept of *ressentiment*:
it was a term that was very much 'in the air' in his lifetime (the late
nineteenth century), as [[Jameson, Fredric]] points out in his
sharp critique of the concept in *The Political Unconscious* (1981).
Jameson's quarrel with *ressentiment*, or more particularly Nietzsche's
deployment of it, is that the latter fails to consider the ideological
weight the term carried in its own time; thus, in Jameson's view
Nietzsche fails to see that it is a category deployed by the ruling
bourgeoisie elite to simultaneously justify their privileges and
rationalize the denial of those same privileges to the poorer classes
(on this view of things, the masses revolt not because their cause is
just, but because they resent the rich).
