[[Rawls, John]] 
(1921--2002)


American political philosopher best known for his work on fairness. Born
in Baltimore, Rawls went to school in Baltimore and Connecticut. He did
his undergraduate degree at Princeton, graduating in 1943. He then
joined the army and saw active service as an infantryman in New Guinea,
the Philippines, and Japan, where he witnessed the aftermath of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima. After the war he returned to Princeton to
complete a doctorate in moral philosophy. He did post-doctoral work at
Oxford University in the early 1950s, where he was influenced by Isaiah
Berlin. He worked then at Cornell and
[[ANT]]
(Massachusetts
Institute of Technology) before obtaining a position at Harvard in 1962,
where he was to remain for the next 40 years. Rawls is best known for
his 1971 magnum opus, *A Theory of Justice*. One of the most cited
humanities books in history, *A Theory of Justice* focuses on the
problem of [[distributive justice]] and introduces two
principles which have since become famous: the principle of liberty and
the principle of difference. The first principle, which Rawls regards as
inviolable, holds that all people must enjoy freedom of speech,
assembly, worship, and so on in order for society to be just; the second
principle, which is more complicated, holds that the economy must be
arranged in such a way that it is of the greatest benefit to the least
well-off and that the opportunity for social advancement is made open to
everyone. *A Theory of Justice* is a much debated work, but it has in
many ways set the agenda for debate about social justice in political
science since its publication nearly four decades ago. His subsequent
publications, particularly *Political Liberalism* (1993) and *The Law of
Peoples* (1999) extended these principles to international politics.
