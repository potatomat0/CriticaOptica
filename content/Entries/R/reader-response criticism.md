[[reader-response criticism]]

 A
mode of literary criticism that prioritizes the role of the reader
(rather than the author's intentions or the text's actual structure) in
both establishing the meaning of a text and evaluating its critical
worth. It grew out of a dissatisfaction with [[New Criticism]] and [[Practical Criticism]] (which operate on
the assumption that it is only the text that matters), and the
recognition that all writers respond to what readers say about their
work and modify their future writing accordingly. The theoretical core
of this mode is derived from both [[Jauss, Hans Robert]]'s [[Reception Aesthetics]] and [[Iser, Wolfgang]]'s [[Reception Theory]]. Hence
reader-response criticism also starts from the ontological premise that
the text does not have full existence until it is read and that as a
consequence its meaning cannot be deduced in isolation from a community
of readers. It differs from Reception Aesthetics and Reception Theory in
that it gives much greater emphasis to the difference between actual
readers. It is much more politically aware in this sense, in that it
recognizes that factors like
[[gender]],
[[race]],
[[class]], and ethnicity have
a necessary influence on the way readers respond to texts. *See also*
