[[readerly]]

 and writerly
**(*lisible* and *scriptible*)** French literary theorist [[Barthes, Roland]] proposed these
terms in *S/Z* (1970), translated as *S/Z* (1974) to distinguish between
literary works that because of their specific formal qualities either
constrain the reader to adhere closely to the text with little or no
room for interpretive manoeuvre (readerly), or, demand that the reader
work hard to make sense of the text and effectively contribute to its
very writing (writerly). The first kind of text renders the reader
passive, while the latter variety forces the reader to become active.
Barthes classifies so-called classical or realist texts, such as George
Eliot's *Middlemarch* (1871--2) and Honoré de Balzac's *Eugénie Grandet*
(1833), as readerly because there is a central organizing plot (usually
in the form of an enigma---either something has happened or is about to
happen, but it isn't immediately known what this is) around which the
story develops in a very structured fashion---it is always known who is
speaking, who they are speaking to and what they are doing and why. In
contrast, a writerly text, and for Barthes this generally means the
[[modernism]] works of
experimental authors like James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, offers the
reader no such clarity of attribution. It is, therefore, a more plural
text in Barthes's view, implying that it gives the reader greater
freedom to construct meanings for themselves. As [[Jameson, Fredric]] argues in *The Modernist Papers* (2007), there is an undisclosed 'cold war' ideology
and politics behind this concept which wants to equate the readerly text
with so-called 'closed' or totalitarian societies and the writerly text
with 'open' or democratic societies (the terms open and closed are
adapted from [[Eco, Umberto]]'s famous 1962 essay,
'The Poetics of the Open Work'). This distinction has fallen into a
state of relative disuse, undoubtedly in part because its politics are
no longer relevant, but also because it is formally untenable: as
several detractors of modernists works have argued, it is just as
plausible to say that writerly texts are tyrannical because they deny
the reader the comfort of a bit of sense. *See also* [work and
