[[reification]]

 The
transformation of intangible human qualities, such as thoughts, ideas,
and values, into physical objects. According to [[Marx, Karl]] all of the key
elements of capitalism involve a greater or lesser degree of
reification. For instance, capitalist production subordinates the lives
of millions of people to its regime of making and selling things. This
fact is obscured by what Marx called [[commodity fetishism]], the process
whereby the socially produced
[[value]] of things is
mistaken for natural value. Reification is a crucial concept for
Hungarian Marxist literary critic [[Lukács, György]], particularly in
his 1923 book *History and Class Consciousness*. Lukács argues that the
priority given to the needs of business (an outlook Max Weber usefully
termed economic rationalism) is a form of reification because it
obscures the social origins of production and privileges the needs of
the system.
