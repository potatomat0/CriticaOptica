[[reaction-formation]]
**(*Reaktionsbildung*)** In
[[psychoanalysis]], a
psychological attitude that is the direct opposite of the repressed wish
(*see* [[repression]]). So an
outgoing and exhibitionist person might act bashful and coy. The
reaction-formation is a
counter-[[cathexis]], a
conscious outlet for
[[desire]] that is equivalent
to or stronger than the usual
[[unconscious]] pathways.
Reaction-formations are regarded as pathological or symptomatic only
when they take on an obsessive character, or the actual results are in
themselves undesirable (e.g. a shy person suddenly becoming overly
exhibitionist).
