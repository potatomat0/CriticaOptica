[[repression]]
**(*Verdr√§ngung*)** In
[[psychoanalysis]], the
process whereby the conscious defends itself against unwelcome thoughts,
impulses, and ideations rising up from the
[[unconscious]]. These
thoughts are unwelcome because they are representatives of one or other
of the [[instinct]], and as
such they strike the conscious's governing body, namely the
[[superego]], as being both
uncivilized and vulgar. Repression is not, however, a single-shot act
like closing the door; it is rather, a constant process akin perhaps to
force exerted by a dam wall to hold back the flow of water behind it.
[[Freud, Sigmund]] conceived
of the idea of repression in trying to explain
[[parapraxis]] (better known
as 'Freudian slips'), which he reasoned are evidence of two things:
first, that these slips of the tongue and so on indicate that there is a
part of the mind not accessible to conscious thought or inspection,
which he called the unconscious; and second, that these unconscious
processes are constantly bombarding and being repelled by the conscious
mind. Freud also came to think that both
[[hysteria]] and
[[projection]] symptoms are a
product of repressed thoughts which have been subjected to either
[[condensation]] or
[[displacement]] and thereby
rendered acceptable to the conscious (they are also known as
'compromise-formations' for obvious reasons). In their newly disguised
state these thoughts are no longer recognizable to the conscious, and
although it had previously repressed them, it now allows them to pass
through without further censorship. Now, however, repression takes on a
new form because it must repress those thoughts and associations which
would betray the true identity of the disguised thoughts and trigger
what Freud called a return of the repressed. Freud referred to these two
moments or types of repression as primal repression and repression
proper.
