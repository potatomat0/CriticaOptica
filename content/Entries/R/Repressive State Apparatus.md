[[Repressive State Apparatus]]
([[RSA]]) The French
[[Marxism]] philosopher
[[Althusser, Louis]]'s concept
for what is known in contemporary political discourse as 'hard power',
i.e. a form of power that operates by means of violence. It is usually
accompanied by what Althusser termed the [[Ideological State Apparatus]], which is a 'soft
power' concept. The Repressive State Apparatus consists of the army, the
police, the judiciary, and the prison system. It operates primarily by
means of mental and physical coercion and violence (latent and actual).
