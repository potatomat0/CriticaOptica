[[rational choice theory]]

 A
framework for modelling economic behaviour which assumes that people
will always seek to optimize their own situation by maximizing wealth
and minimizing costs and will only choose to act in favour of others if
there is also a clear benefit to themselves. Economists do not claim
that rational choice theory is an exhaustive description of human
society, only that it is a workable assumption.
