[[relativism]]

 In philosophy,
the position that all value judgements (e.g. ethics, morality, and
truth) are relative to the standpoint of the beholder. To put it another
way, relativism does not accept that there is an absolute ground or
reference point that could provide an objective guarantee that things
are not necessarily the same as they are perceived to be by a given
subject. If one is neither religious nor a hard-headed
[[seriality]], then some
version of relativism is unavoidable, which creates a great many
difficulties for philosophers in this situation because it is easy
(though not necessarily accurate or just) to turn this into an
accusation. [[postmodernism]]
has been taken to task on numerous occasions for precisely this reason:
it challenges the plausibility and possibility of an absolute ground. As
a consequence it has been charged with being apolitical, ahistorical,
unethical, and so on, because all these things---politics, history,
ethics, etc.---are said to require a ground to function properly. As
[[Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois]]
shows, the problem with relativism is that it enables historical
[[revisionism]] such as
Holocaust-deniers to claim that their position is as valid as any other.
His solution, only partially successful, is to focus on what he calls
truth-regimes. [[Badiou, Alain]] offers a slightly
different solution to the same problem via a retooling of [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s concept of the
project. Badiou's project is that which attracts political conviction,
i.e. a belief equal in strength to religious belief. *See also*
