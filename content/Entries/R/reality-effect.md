[[reality-effect]]

 **(*effet de
r√©el*)** The small details of person, place, and action that while
contributing little or nothing to the narrative, give the story its
atmosphere, making it feel real. It does not add to the plot to know
that the character James Bond wears Egyptian cotton shirts, but it
clearly does add considerably to our understanding of him. By the same
token, knowing that he buys his food from Fortnum and Mason makes him
more real. Thus, as [[Barthes, Roland]] argues in his
essay introducing this concept, 'The Reality Effect' (1968), reprinted
in *The Rustle of Language* (1984) no analysis of a text can be
considered complete if it does not take these seemingly insignificant
details into account.
