[[reality principle]]
**(*Realit√§tsprinzip*)** The counterbalance to the [[pleasure principle]] in [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s early account of
mental functioning. It regulates and restricts the
[[subject]]'s search for the
immediate satisfaction of their
[[desire]], postponing
gratification according to the conditions imposed by external reality.
The reality principle emerges after the pleasure principle and only
takes formation when the psychical apparatus has undergone significant
development (i.e. when the rational processes of judgement gain
ascendancy in the conscious). The reality principle never attains
absolute mastery over the pleasure principle, particularly where the
sexual [[instinct]] are
concerned, so it must constantly reassert itself.
