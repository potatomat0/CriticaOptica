[[Reception Theory]]
**(*Wirkungstheorie*)** German literary theorist [[Iser, Wolfgang]]'s term for his theory
of the reader's construction of texts. As Iser points out in his seminal
work, *Der Akt des Lesens: Theorie Ã¤sthetischer Wirkung* (1976),
translated as *The Act of Reading* (1978), Reception Theory is
interested in trying to understand the actual process of reading itself,
in contrast to [[chiasmus]]'s
[[Reception Aesthetics]],
which is interested in how existing texts are read and responded to. Its
key ontological assumption is that the text does not properly exist
until it is read, which is to say it exists only in the moment of
reading. It is this productive moment that Reception Theory tries to
understand and articulate by drawing on and adapting the conceptual
resources of
[[phenomenology]]. Its key
question is: how and under what conditions is a text meaningful to a
reader? Iser's answer is that as readers we passively synthesize images
on the basis of what we read---this means we form images in our minds as
they come to us, not as a deliberate, intentional, or conscious act. We
constantly adjust these images as new information comes to hand. In
doing so, we must push to the background our own thoughts and memories
and thus allow what we are reading to occupy the foreground. This
process has the effect of alienating our own thoughts, thereby putting
them into a fresh perspective. According to Iser, then, this is what
makes reading 'improving' in a moral and ethical sense. It is worth
adding the following caution: *Wirkungstheorie* is sometimes translated
as reader-response theory (indeed, Iser himself suggests response as the
most viable translation of *Wirkung*), but in spite of similarities it
is not the same thing. *See also* [reader-response
