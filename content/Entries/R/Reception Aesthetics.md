[[Reception Aesthetics]]
**(*Rezeptionsästhetik*)** German literary theorist [[Jauss, Hans Robert]]'s term for his
theory that the history of literature can only be fully understood as a
[[dialectic]] relationship
between the production of texts and their reception by readers. It is
readers, Jauss argues, that determine the aesthetic value of a work and
it is the accumulated responses of readers across time that constitutes
the aesthetic itself. Jauss was particularly interested in the influence
of readers on writers and the more or less unspoken interaction between
the two which transforms history into aesthetics. Influenced by
[[Russian Formalism]] as well
as [[phenomenology]]
critics like [[Gadamer, Hans-Georg]], Jauss uses the
notion of 'horizon of expectation' (*Erwartungshorizont*) to
characterize the status quo in literature and suggests that readers
respond most favourably to works whose novelty (which he defines in
terms very similar to
[[ostranenie]]) challenges
that status quo and thereby creates a new horizon of expectation. The
rapid evolution of [[magical realism]] offers an excellent
and recent case in point: the publication of Gabriel García Márquez's
novel, *Cien años de soledad* (1967), translated as *One Hundred Years
of Solitude* (1970), created the possibility for Salman Rushdie's
*Midnight's Children* (1981), which in turn led to a popular appetite
for literature of this type. *See also* [reader-response
