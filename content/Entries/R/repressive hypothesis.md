[[repressive hypothesis]]
[[Foucault, Michel]]'s term
for the perception, which he demonstrates is historically false, that
the Victorian era was silent on the issue of sex and sexuality. The era
that was famously so morbidly fearful of the merest hint of sex that it
covered the legs of pianos lest they call to mind naked human legs was
as this very example illustrates obsessively concerned with sex. As
Foucault argues in *La Volont√© de savoir* (1976), translated as *The History of Sexuality: An Introduction* (1978), under the guise of
repression sex became an object, or even more strongly, an incitement to
knowledge in the Victorian era.
