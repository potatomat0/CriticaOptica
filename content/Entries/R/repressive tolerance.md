[[repressive tolerance]]

 The
passive acceptance of social and governmental practices, policies and
actions which restrict freedom in an absolute sense. The [[Frankfurt School]] theorist [[Marcuse, Herbert]] coined the term in
an essay of that title for a book co-written with Robert Wolff and
Barrington Moore, *Critique of Pure Tolerance* (1965). Repressive
tolerance, Marcuse argues, takes two main forms: (i) the unthinking
acceptance of entrenched attitudes and ideas, even when these are
obviously damaging to other people, or indeed the environment (the
painfully slow response to warnings about climate change and
environmental degradation might be seen as an example of this); and (ii)
the vocal endorsement of actions that are manifestly aggressive towards
other people (the popular support in the US and the UK in the aftermath
of 9/11 and 7/7 for the respective government's attempts to override or
limit *habeas corpus* is a clear example of this). Genuine tolerance,
Marcuse argues, can only exist in a situation of intolerance for these
limits on real freedom. [[Žižek, Slavoj]]'s books *Violence*
(2008) and *In Defence of Lost Causes* (2008) continue and update this
line of thought.
