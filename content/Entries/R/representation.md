[[representation]]

 The image of
an idea or thing. At its most basic, representation means two things:
(i) creating something that can stand for another thing---this is the
sense in which a
[[metaphor]], to give only
one example, is a form of representation; but it also applies to
representative politics in which an elected person stands for their
electorate in a particular political forum; (ii) creating something that
is in at least some sense equivalent to another thing, most often
because it resembles that other thing. For example, a photograph is a
representation because its image closely resembles the actual object on
a two-dimensional plane, but it is also (obviously, but this point is
often forgotten) not the same as that other thing. [[critical theory]], particularly the
[[post-structuralism]]
modulation, has taken a keen interest in representation because of the
central problem of the relationship between the thing and its
representation. [[Cultural Studies]] has also taken a
keen interest in the problem of representation, recognizing that it is
central to the kinds of political questions surrounding
[[identity]] it is concerned
with.
