[[realism]]

 **1.** In the arts,
particularly literature and the visual arts, it refers to the
nineteenth-century movement that was the precursor to
[[modernism]]. It called
itself realism because it broke with the artistic conventions of the
times and challenged the accepted view of what art should be, namely the
pursuit of the beautiful, the moral, and the improving, and instead
claimed that it should try to record and, where necessary, indict what
is. In art this was achieved by means of heightened
[[verisimilitude]] in
[[representation]], while in
literature it was achieved by exploring the inner motivations of
characters, who were drawn from [[everyday life]].
**2.** In philosophy, the position that the only acceptable argument,
idea, or theorem, is one that can be verified independently of a
subjective observer. It is premised on the view that the world exists
and is not an artefact of the mind (as an extreme
[[relativism]] might argue),
nor simply an effect of language. Its goal is to describe the world as
accurately as possible in objective terms. It tends to align itself very
closely with mathematics and the physical sciences. Since not all
phenomena are verifiable by mind-independent means, this position is
ultimately very limited in what it can deal with.
