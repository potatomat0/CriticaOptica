[[Richards, Ivor Armstrong]]
(1893--1979) British literary critic, leading exponent of [[Practical Criticism]], born in Sandbach
in Cheshire. Richards's parents were, as [[Eagleton, Terry]] puts it in his
surprisingly affirmative essay 'The Rise of English' (chapter one of
*Literary Theory: An Introduction*, 1983), 'provincial petty
bourgeoisie', meaning that he belonged to a social class that had
hitherto been excluded from university. He was educated at Clifton
College in Bristol and at Cambridge University. He lectured and tutored
in English and the Moral Sciences at Cambridge from 1922 until 1929,
when he took a year off to take up a fellowship in Beijing. In 1931 he
accepted a visiting position at Harvard. In due course his position
there was made permanent and he spent the remainder of his career in the
US.
When Richards started teaching at Cambridge in the early 1920s, English
Literature did not exist as a scholarly discipline and its study was
viewed with suspicion. Yet within a decade it had become a vital part of
the university and has only grown in strength since then. Richards,
along with his former student [[James, C. L. R.]], was instrumental
in this development. In large part, this was because Richards and Leavis
transformed the study of literature from a question of mere taste (i.e.
what one likes and doesn't like) into a question of moral education and
judgement (i.e. whether or not a text can teach us something important
about how we should conduct our lives). As Eagleton puts it, English
Literature became the arena in which the fundamental questions of human
existence were thrown into relief and put under intense examination via
a process that became known as 'close reading'. Literature was to pick
up where religion left off and provide moral order in the midst of
chaos. Despite writing prolifically on the subject of what counts as
good literature and why it is important, Richards did not really
establish an aesthetic that could be emulated. He treated poetry, in
particular, as transparent windows into the
[[psyche]] of poets, yet did
so in such a way that one would have to be him to see it as he does. Yet
as Eagleton points out, the true achievement of Richards and Leavis is
not the methods they created, which have been superseded anyway, but the
transformation of literature into a scholarly object. Richards's most
important books are: *The Meaning of Meaning* (1923), which he
co-authored with C. K. Ogden; *The Principles of Literary Criticism*
(1924); and *Practical Criticism* (1929). Interestingly, Richards's work
proved more enduringly influential in the US (where he is credited as
one of the fathers of [[New Criticism]]) than in his
native country.
