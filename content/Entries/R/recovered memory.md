[[recovered memory]]

 Repressed
memory, usually of a traumatic event, recalled during psychoanalytic
therapy. The concept was developed by [[Freud, Sigmund]] in the early stages
of his thinking about
[[psychoanalysis]], when he
assumed that [[field]]
desires must have some basis in fact, but because the events were
disturbing to the individual the memory of them was buried in a place
beyond recall (this is his so-called seduction theory). Freud quickly
abandoned this theory when he realized that oedipal thoughts could be
just as potent if they were imagined. The concept of recovered memory is
controversial because there is significant evidence to suggest that in
the majority of cases the so-called memories that are recalled are in
fact phantasms of events that took place only in the unconscious.
