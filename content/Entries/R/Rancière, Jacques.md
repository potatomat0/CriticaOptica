[[Rancière, Jacques]]
 (1940--)


French philosopher. Born in Algeria, Rancière completed his
undergraduate studies in Paris at the prestigious finishing school,
École Normale
Supérieure ([[ANT]]). There
Rancière, along with fellow students [[Balibar, Étienne]], [[Macherey, Pierre]], and [[Pêcheux, Michel]], worked very
closely with [[Althusser, Louis]]. They all
collaborated on a major re-reading of
[[Marxism]], which culminated in
the publication of *Lire le capital* (1968), translated as *Reading Capital* (1970). However, almost as soon as the book was published the
group fell out with Althusser over his failure to respond to the events
of [[May ’68]], and in
subsequent editions the contributions of everyone except Balibar were
excised. Rancière settles his account with Althusser in the rather stern
critique *La Leçon d'Althusser* (*The Lesson of Althusser*, 1974). A
highly prolific author, Rancière's many publications have focused on
three main areas of interest---aesthetics, politics, and pedagogy and
explored the interrelationships between the three.
