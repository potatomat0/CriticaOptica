[[real]] 

(*r√©el*)

 One of the
three 'orders' structuring human existence, according to French
[[psychoanalysis]] [[Lacan, Jacques]] (the other two are
the [[imaginary]] and the
[[symbolic]]). The real is
that which resists
[[representation]]
absolutely. It is in this sense impossible to imagine for itself (if we
could imagine it, we could represent it). As such, it is impossible to
integrate into the symbolic order, which means---somewhat
paradoxically---that the real is in fact opposed to reality. Therefore
our encounter with the real is always traumatic.
