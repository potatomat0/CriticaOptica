[[race]]

 The biological,
physiological, or genetic classification of humans according to
distinctive features of physical appearance such as skin colour, shape
of face, hair colour, body morphology. It is generally used in a binary
fashion to identify both a superior race and an inferior race.
Throughout history, but especially since the rise of the African slave
trade, the concept of race has been of concern to western political
thinkers, who use it to justify and legitimate the invasive,
exploitative, and predatory actions of their governments. In critical
theory, race is thus treated as a problematic term whose history is
instructive because it shows how power and
[[ideology]] combine to
facilitate the unjust and unequal treatment of others by
[[hegemony]] powers. Recent
scholarship in postcolonial studies has demonstrated that race is an
important issue for non-western political philosophy as well. Because of
its associations with colonialism, eugenics, and slavery, race has not
been used in an affirmative sense in critical theory since the 1970s,
when affirmative terms such as
[[n√©gritude]] began to lose
their currency. It has been replaced by
[[ethnicity]] in this regard.
