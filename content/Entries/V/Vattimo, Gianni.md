[[Vattimo, Gianni]]
 (1936--)


Italian philosopher. Born in Turin, Vattimo studied philosophy at the
University of Turin, graduating in 1959. He then went to Heidelberg to
complete his doctoral studies under the supervision of renowned
hermeneuticists Karl Löwith and [[Gadamer, Hans-Georg]]. He returned to
Turin in 1964 to take up a position at his alma mater, a link he has
maintained for his entire career. In 1999, Vattimo was elected to the
European Parliament on the Party of Italian Communists ticket. He
remained there until 2004, when he resigned from the party. He has since
then worked as a journalist, but remains active in European politics.
Although openly gay, Vattimo is not a [[auteur theory]] as such. He is a
Catholic and several of his works, including a collaboration with
[[Derrida, Jacques]],
*Religion* (1998), deal with religious and theological issues. Vattimo
is best known as an exponent of [[weak thought]], or weak
[[ontology]], which takes the
view that since there is no strong link between language and reality
there are only interpretations; the task of philosophy under such
conditions is to develop better and more rigorous interpretations.
Consequently,
[[hermeneutics]] is in
Vattimo's view the principal mode of doing philosophy today. Vattimo is
in this respect usefully thought of as a
[[postmodern]] philosopher,
albeit one closer in his thinking to [[Rorty, Richard]] than [[Lyotard, Jean-François]]. His best-known
works are *La fine della modernità* (1985), translated as *The End of
Modernity: Nihilism and Hermeneutics in Post-Modern Culture* (1991) and
*La società trasparente* (1989), translated as *The Transparent Society*
(1994).
