[[Vaneigem, Raoul]]
 (1934--)


Belgian anarchist philosopher who, along with [[Debord, Guy]], was one of the key
theorists of
[[Situationism]]. Born in
Lessines, Belgium, he studied at the Free University of Brussels before
moving to Paris. In 1960 he sent samples of his poetry to [[Lefebvre, Henri]] who in turn
passed them along to his student Guy Debord, thus facilitating their
meeting and future collaborations. Vaneigem's most famous book, *Traité
de savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes générations* (1967), translated as
*The Revolution of Everyday Life* (1983), was published shortly before
the irruption of student protest in [[May ’68]] and many of the slogans
the students graffitied on walls were lifted from this text. A prolific
writer and principal contributor to *Internationale Situationniste*,
Vaneigem used pseudonyms for his more polemical texts. Consistent with
the Situationist outlook, but also showing the influence of [[Reich, Wilhelm]], Vaneigem's thesis
was that only creative, poetic activity can rescue us from the
inauthenticity of everyday life in the capitalist world. This theme is
continued in recent works such as *Le Mouvement du libre-esprit* (1986),
translated as *The Movement of the Free Spirit* (1994).
