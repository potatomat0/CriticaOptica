[[Veblen, Thorstein]]
(1857--1929) Norwegian-American sociologist and pioneering cultural
theorist. His best known work, *The Theory of the Leisure Class* (1899),
spawned the well-known phrase 'conspicuous consumption', which so aptly
describes the antics of the super wealthy. Veblen was born in Wisconsin.
His well-to-do parents were recent immigrants from Norway who spoke
Norwegian at home. He obtained a BA in economics from Carleton College
in Minnesota. He then did graduate work, first at Johns Hopkins
University, under the founder of American
[[pragmatism]], [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]], and then
at Yale, where he completed a PhD in 1884. In 1891 he was appointed
professor of economics at the newly created University of Chicago. He
taught there until 1906, when he moved to Stanford. He was to remain at
Stanford only a short time, moving to the University of Missouri in
1911. In 1919 he moved to New York, taking a position as an editor for
*The Dial* (then in its heyday as the audacious publisher of
[[modernism]] works by T. S.
Eliot, William Butler Yeats, and Ezra Pound, among others). During this
period he collaborated with Charles Beard, James Harvey Robinson, and
John Dewey to establish the New School for Social Research. If Veblen's
work is still a standard feature of introductory sociology courses it is
because of *The Theory of the Leisure Class*, which is at once a biting
satire and a keen analysis of the social use of wealth in the early part
of the twentieth century. What intrigued (and disgusted) Veblen was the
way money was spent uselessly by the scions of the so-called 'Gilded
Age' merely to demonstrate that they could afford it. He also analysed
the way the wealthy classes adopt certain fashions, emulating one
another so as to reassure themselves of their belonging together.
