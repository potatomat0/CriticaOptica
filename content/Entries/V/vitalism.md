[[vitalism]]

 In philosophy, the
position that life in all its forms cannot be explained adequately or
completely in either chemical or physical terms. It assumes there must
be some 'higher' or 'other' dimension as well, such as the 'soul' or
[[Bergson, Henri]]'s notion of
the *Ã©lan vital*. Vitalist principles have been at the heart of medical
thinking since at least the time of the ancient Egyptians, but in the
latter half of the twentieth century fell into decline as scientists
came to believe that the chemical and physical accounts of life were
sufficient and anything beyond that was an unnecessary abstraction, or
worse, obfuscation.
