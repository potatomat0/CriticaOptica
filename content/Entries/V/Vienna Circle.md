[[Vienna Circle]] 

(*der Wiener Kreis*)  A group of philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists
who met in Vienna in the 1920s and 1930s whose work became known as
[[logical positivism]]. The
meetings were initiated and chaired by Moritz Schlick, a physicist from
Berlin appointed to a chair in theoretical physics at Vienna University
in 1922. Membership of the circle included such luminaries as Rudolf
Carnap, Kurt GÃ¶del, Otto Neurath, and Hans Hahn. The group was disbanded
when Schlick was murdered by an anti-Jewish former student on the steps
of his university building in 1936. Schlick was not in fact Jewish, but
many of the other members of the circle were and they fled the country
(mostly to America) before the Anschluss with Nazi Germany was announced
in March 1938. The group produced a manifesto stipulating the core
beliefs of their scientific world-conception: first, that knowledge only
comes from experience (effectively a flat rejection of
[[metaphysics]]); second,
that the world can only be properly known by the application of logical
analysis, which separates those statements which can be reduced to
simpler statements referring to an empirical reality, and those which
cannot and therefore contain logical errors or confusions. The ultimate
goal of the Vienna Circle was a unified science, but it was never
finally realized.
