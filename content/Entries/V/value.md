[[value]]

 A measure for
distinguishing the absolute and relative worth of a thing (an object or
a service) both to its owner and to others. Intrinsically hierarchical,
value is used in a number of different disciplines. It is theorized in
two main ways, as an ethical problem and as an economic problem (recent
work in sustainability studies tries to combine these two problems so
that the ethical choice and the economic choice are one and the same
thing).
Ethics uses value as a means of determining the difference between the
various ideas and concepts impacting on [[everyday life]], such as the notions of
freedom and life which come into conflict over issues like the right to
life of the unborn foetus versus the right to decide of the mother, or
equally problematically the right to die of terminally ill patients
versus the medical profession's commitment to life. As both [[Foucault, Michel]] and [[Agamben, Giorgio]] have pointed out,
however, placing a value on life in this way has given rise to a new
form of [[governmentality]]
that they both describe as
[[biopower]].
In economics, it is [[Marx, Karl]], above all others,
who has devoted the most effort to thinking through what value means.
But his theory builds on a long line of philosophical inquiry, beginning
with Aristotle who first observed that there is a difference between the
use-value of a thing (what a thing is worth to a person who actually
uses it) and the exchange-value of a thing (what another person would be
willing to trade for a particular thing). In use-value it is the
intrinsic physical properties of the thing itself which are determinant
(e.g. one axe can chop wood better than another because it is made from
better materials); while exchange-value is a social construction and
varies constantly according to the whims and tastes of a particular
society (e.g. fashion).
Aristotle saw as aberrant the fact that (putting it in contemporary
terms) a car could have a higher value than a house, when the latter is
obviously of far greater use to its owner than the car. Marx saw this
state of affairs as normal in capitalism and set out to explain it,
basing his theory of value, the so-called 'labour theory of value', on
classical economist David Ricardo's famous work *Principles of Political
Economy and Taxation* (1817). Marx defined value relative to the
'socially necessary abstract labour' embodied (or stored) in a given
commodity. If a table takes 10 hours to produce and a car 10,000 hours
to produce then the car is more valuable than the table. This fact is
obscured by the way that money (which for Marx is a
[[commodity]]) standardizes
the exchange-value of all things.
