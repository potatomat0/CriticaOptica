[[Virilio, Paul]]
 (1932--)


French architectural theorist. Best known for his essays on speed and
war Virilio ranks alongside [[Baudrillard, Jean]] as one of the
most provocative and counter-intuitive essayists on the impact of
technology in the
[[postmodern]] era.
Virilio was born in Paris in 1932. He grew up in the northern coastal
region of Brittany. When the Germans invaded, his hometown was subjected
to heavy attack and then prolonged military occupation. It was also
bombed by the Allies because it was used as a military port by the
Germans. In later life, Virilio would often say that the war was his
university. His choice of subject matter for his research certainly
bears this out.
Virilio's path into academia was circuitous. Initially he studied at the
École des Métiers d' Art, specializing in working with stained glass. He
then worked alongside the great French artist Henri Matisse helping to
restore churches. In 1950 he converted to Catholicism. His compulsory
military service came at a time when France was fighting against Algeria
in its War of Independence, so Virilio was sent there for his tour of
duty. After completing military service Virilio went to the Sorbonne to
study philosophy. His teachers there included [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]], who sparked
his interest in
[[phenomenology]].
In 1958 Virilio conducted a phenomenological analysis of the 'Atlantic
Wall', the fortifications network the Germans constructed on the French
coastline (near where Virilio grew up) with a view to repelling the
Allied invasion. Consisting of over 15,000 concrete bunkers, these
defences nevertheless failed because the Allies were able to use their
superior weaponry, principally the air force, to neutralize it. To
Virilio, who published his study under the title *Bunker archéologie*
(1975) translated as *Bunker Archaeology* (1994), this demonstrates not
only the importance of speed in modern warfare, but the multiple ways in
which the landscape of the battlefield must be viewed. As Virilio
theorises with his concept of the 'fleet in being' (which
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[authority]] adopt in their
account of the [[war machine]]), controlling a
space no longer requires its constant occupation---now it is enough to
be able to move rapidly to interdict a possible attack.
The subject of several of his books, speed is a key interest for
Virilio. In 1977 he published *Vitesse et politique*, which was
translated into English in 1986 as *Speed and Politics*. The first of
his works to be translated into English, this was the entry point for
Anglophone readers and though Virilio has written on a great many topics
besides speed, he is generally thought of as a theorist of speed or as
he himself terms it 'dromology'. Virilio is ambivalent about speed. In
contrast to the
[[Futurism]], he does not
regard it as intrinsically liberating; indeed, many of his works show
that speed can be an utterly repressive force. In later work, Virilio
connects speed to the development of digital technology, particularly
surveillance technology, and argues that cinema itself is a kind of
weapon. His most provocative thesis in this respect is undoubtedly his
claim in *Guerre et cinéma* (1984), translated as *War and Cinema*
(1989) that Adolf Hitler conceived of World War Two as a kind of movie.
Digital technology, Virilio argues, has so transformed the contemporary
world in terms of speed of communications it has resulted in a kind of
inertia---we no longer need to move, as we once did, in order to
communicate across vast distances. And this inertia, which is the
subject of his short book *L'Inertie polaire* (1990), translated as
*Polar Inertia* (1999), has resulted in the paradoxical disappearance of
the local. Although we no longer need to move, we are nonetheless nodal
points in a vast network of communications, such that a virus released
in one part of the world will in a very short space of time come to
infect the entire world, or at least put the entire world at risk of
infection.
Virilio is a provocative writer, but he is more of an essayist than a
theorist or historian. And though his pronouncements are (or at least
can be) thought-provoking, they can also be frustratingly gnomic and
unsubstantiated.
