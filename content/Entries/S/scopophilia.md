[[scopophilia]]

 A
[[psychoanalysis]] concept
created by [[Freud, Sigmund]]
to describe the pleasure in looking, or what is more usually known as
voyeurism. It is widely used in film studies, for obvious reasons,
particularly by feminist scholars, to describe cinema's popularity as an
artistic medium. The best known articulation of this concept is Laura
Mulvey's account of it in her 1975 essay, 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative
Cinema'. Mulvey argues that the act of viewing cinema can usefully be
compared to the developmental moment [[Lacan, Jacques]] referred to as the
[[mirror stage]] because the
sense of 'escape' we feel while watching a movie is reminiscent of the
[[imaginary]] 'world' of a
child whose [[ego]] has not
yet formed, while the heroic figures seen on screen offer us examples of
[[ego-ideal]] to identify
with. But, she argues, perception is gendered, meaning that men and
women view things differently, or more precisely are positioned
differently by the things they view. Men see their
[[fantasy]] projected on
screen, while women see themselves depicted as the sexual objects of
men's fantasy---Mulvey argues that it does not alter things if it is in
fact a male body women are gazing at because in doing so they are still
inhabiting the male heterosexual fantasy space.
