[[Second Wave feminism]]

 A
shorthand reference for the politically active form of
[[feminism]] that emerged in
the US and elsewhere in the 1960s. It was neither a unified nor a
homogeneous movement, but it did of course have a common goal, however
disparately this was conceived, namely the equality of the sexes. It was
born of the recognition that in spite of the considerable advances of
the retrospectively christened [[First Wave feminism]], women had still
not achieved genuine equality with men in every facet of life. Its
starting point, in the US, was [[Friedan, Betty]]'s *The Feminine
Mystique* (1963), which argues that women are trapped in a system that
denies them self-identity as women and demands they find fulfilment
through their husbands and children. Later writers, particularly those
identifying as [[radical feminism]], would use the
term [[patriarchy]] as a
shorthand for this systemic subordination of women at the level of
[[culture]] itself, rather
than individual men.
In 1966, the National Organization for Women
([[BWO]]) was formed, as a
civil rights organization for women, and in many respects it became the
driving force of Second Wave feminism, particularly on the political
front. NOW lobbied the US government to adopt the
Equal Rights
Amendment ([[RSA]]), but while
it had many victories at State level, it remained without ultimate
success at Federal level.
In 1970, a NOW committee member [[Millett, Kate]] published her PhD
dissertation *Sexual Politics*, arguing that there is in effect a
patriarchal and a non-patriarchal way of writing, with D. H. Lawrence,
Normal Mailer, and Henry Miller falling into the former category and
Jean Genet into the latter. The book sparked a huge debate and was
attacked quite savagely by Norman Mailer; it is frequently held up as an
example of what is wrong with [[political correctness]]. Nonetheless,
Millett's work offered an early and powerful critique of the patriarchal
values in art and literature. Australian critic Germaine Greer's *The Female Eunuch* (1970) was published in the same year, causing a similar
stir by suggesting that the way to fight patriarchy is through women
taking charge of their own sexuality.
The extent to which sex is a neglected problem of violence and
exploitation was brought to light by Susan Brownmiller's angry expos√©,
*Against Our Will* (1975). Brownmiller's book divided feminism into two
separate and opposed camps: those like Greer who advocate sexual
promiscuity as a political weapon and those like Brownmiller who see
this as simply catering to a male-dominated view of
[[desire]]. Second Wave
feminism came to an end in the early 1980s. In part, it was a victim of
its own success because there was a powerful backlash against political
correctness, even among women, who found some of its messages 'over the
top'. But the far bigger problem was the profoundly unfavourable
political conditions that materialized in the 1980s: both Ronald Reagan
in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK were anti-ERA in their outlook
and policy-making. Second Wave feminism has since been succeeded by
[[Third Wave feminism]] on
the one hand and
[[post-feminism]] on the
other.
