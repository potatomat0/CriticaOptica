[[Spivak, Gayatri]].
Independently of academia, global businesses (particularly in Japan)
have discovered that a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to marketing does not
work and that what is required is rather an embedding of their products
in a local context. Thus at the start of the new millennium CNN
abandoned its model of one centralized newsdesk broadcasting to the
world and created instead several localized newsdesks, each one tailored
to the specific cultural, ethnic, and political concerns of its region.
There is also an activist dimension to this term, as is exemplified in
the slogan 'Think globally, act locally'.
