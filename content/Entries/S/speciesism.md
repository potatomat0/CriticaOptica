[[speciesism]]

 A prejudice or
exceptionalism exhibited by one species (typically humans) with regard
to another species (typically animals in general). The term was first
used by British psychologist Richard Ryder in 1973 and has since been
adopted by a large number of critics, most notably animal rights
campaigner Peter Singer. Generally speaking, the charge of speciesism is
made wherever and whenever the rights humans enjoy are not extended to
other species---in particular, this implies the right of animals not to
be kept in captivity, eaten, or experimented upon. The key issue is
whether or not humans are morally and ethically justified in regarding
themselves as a superior species with a sovereign right to treat all
other earthly creatures as resources. As one might expect, opinion is
divided quite sharply on this issue.
