[[simulation]]

 A general term
for the aesthetic, cultural, and philosophical problem of the relation
between original and copy. [[Benjamin, Walter]], writing about
the mass production of cultural commodities in latter part of the
nineteenth century, was one of the first to draw attention to its
significance. His concept of
[[aura]] was conceived to
articulate his thesis that multiplying the number of copies of a thing
tended to degrade the symbolic potency of the original. Several decades
later, [[Eco, Umberto]]
reached basically the same conclusion writing about what he called the
[[hyperreality]] of
contemporary or
[[postmodern]] life,
especially in the US. Mystified by the apparent passion in the US for
replicas of European icons such as one sees par excellence in Las Vegas,
Eco theorized that simulation is an attempt to produce something more
real than the real itself and in that way compensate for its absence or
impossibility. For Baudrillard, who is undoubtedly the theorist most
well known for his interest in simulation, it is the generation by
models of a real without origin or reality, or what he also calls a
hyperreal. As he explains in *Simulacres et simulation* (1981),
translated as *Simulacra and Simulation* (1994), in such circumstances
the usual order of things is reversed: the copy no longer follows the
original, it now precedes it. But more than that, simulation threatens
to erode the distinction between real and copy, true and false,
imaginary and real, and so on, and that is why postmodernism, which
according to Baudrillard is defined by the presence of simulation at
every level, is so alarming. His example of this process is the famous
cave drawings in the caves at Lascaux. Because they are so old and
fragile the caves are sealed off from visitors, apart from a tiny
peephole; but so as to satisfy the tourists' desire to see them at close
hand a full-scale replica has been constructed nearby. Thus, Baudrillard
says, the duplicate renders the original artificial: it is not the
'real' that visitors carry away in their memories. It is not difficult
to extrapolate from this line of argument that film, TV, and especially
the Internet, also perform a similar function, on a much bigger scale.
