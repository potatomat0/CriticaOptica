[[synecdoche]]

 A standard form
in [[rhetoric]] in which
either a part can be made to stand in for a whole, or a whole can stand
in for a part. For example, in the phrase 'Washington said...' commonly
heard on TV news, Washington is a whole standing in for the actual
individuals who work in the US federal government; but it is also a part
of the US standing in for the whole of the country.
