[[solipsism]]

 The extreme
thesis that only the self exists. It arises from the view that only the
self can be known with any certainty. On this view of things, it can be
acknowledged that other consciousnesses may exist, but since those
consciousnesses cannot be known their existence must remain speculative.
Because of its
[[anti-foundationalism]] stance,
[[postmodern]] philosophy is
frequently accused of solipsism, as were many of the key
[[post-structuralism]] figures
like [[Derrida, Jacques]] and
[[Foucault, Michel]].
