[[Strauss, Leo]] 
(1899--1973)


German-born Jewish-American political philosopher, generally regarded as
the 'father' of neoconservative thinking. He completed his PhD at the
University of Hamburg under the direction of Ernst Cassirer in 1921. He
also took classes at Freiburg, where his teachers included [[Husserl, Edmund]] and [[Heidegger, Martin]]. He was active
in the Zionist movement in Germany and intellectually engaged with
several of its key figures, such as Franz Rosenzweig and Gershom
Scholem. He left Germany in 1932 to go to the US on a Rockefeller
Fellowship, but because of the rise of Nazism chose not to return to
Germany at the fellowship's conclusion. Instead he went to Paris, and
then Cambridge, before resolving finally to relocate to the US, which he
did in 1937. After several years of precarious living on short-term
contracts at a variety of universities, he finally attained a tenured
position at the University of Chicago, which is where he really made his
mark with several books that offered both a rereading of the history of
philosophy from Plato to
[[cathexis]] and a coherent
political doctrine. It was the latter aspect (reinforced by the first)
that was to prove the most influential. Strauss's principal themes were,
according to [[Anderson, Perry]]'s incisive
critique in *Spectrum* (2005), that a just order must be based on the
demands of natural right and that nature is inherently unequal. The best
political regime, he reasoned, is one that takes human inequality into
account and is led by a select elite. It is not difficult to see why
this appeals to neoconservatives. Strauss tends to be better remembered
for who his students were, rather than for specific books or ideas: his
students included [[Bloom, Allan]], Paul Wolfowitz (a
key figure in George W. Bush's administration), and [[Sontag, Susan]]. He is also cited
as an important influence by [[Fukuyama, Francis]].
