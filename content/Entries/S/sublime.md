[[sublime]]

 A quality a
concept, object, or experience may be said to have if it is
breath-taking, unique, incomparable, and beyond words. As several
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century travellers noted, the Alps are
sublime in this sense because nothing at ground level prepares one for
the view from their austere peaks, where earth and sky seem to meet
(e.g., Caspar David Friedrich's famous painting, *Wanderer above the Sea
of Fog* (1817)). Western aesthetics has been interested in the concept of
the sublime since at least the first century, when the Greek scholar of
[[rhetoric]] Longinus wrote
his treatise *On the Sublime*. But it was not until the publication of
Edmund Burke's *A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of
the Sublime and Beautiful* (1756) that it became a topic of
philosophical interest. Burke's opposition between beauty as that which
is well-formed and pleasing and sublime as that which is ugly, fearful
and desirable all at once continues to inform thinking on this subject
still. In effect, Burke's distinction is between that which we perceive
with simple [[pleasure]] (the
beautiful) and that which truly moves us (sublime). German philosopher,
[[Kant, Immanuel]] adopts
Burke's opposition and uses it to discuss the limits of the imagination
and the senses in contrast to the power of reason. In the
[[postmodern]] era, French
philosopher [[Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois]] has utilized the
concept of the sublime to describe his vision of what political art
should do. For Lyotard the sublime is the presence of the necessarily
failed attempt to say the unsayable, to bring forth and articulate the
wrong inherent in a
[[differend]]. It is this
kind of sublime that Daniel Libeskind was no doubt aiming for in his
design for the extension to the Jewish Museum in Berlin.
