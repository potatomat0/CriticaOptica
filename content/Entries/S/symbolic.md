[[symbolic]]
 (*symbolique*)

 One
of the three 'orders' (the others are the
[[imaginary]] and the
[[real]]) which, according to
Jacques Lacan, structure human existence. Lacan adapted the concept from
the work of French anthropologist [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]], who, in
turn, took his model from the work of Swiss linguist [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. Taking
Saussure's idea that the signifier is arbitrary in its relation to the
signified, that there is in effect no necessary link between a
representation and its meaning, Lévi-Strauss extended this principle to
all cultural phenomena and argued that what had to be understood was the
symbolic system that gives all phenomena their specific meanings. Lacan
adopts this argument and adds two important implications of his own:
first, that the unconscious must be structured like a language for it to
have produced such a system and to be able to exist within it; second,
that the [[subject]] is born
into the symbolic system which they have to learn to use and this
experience is [[alienation]].
For Lacan the maturation of the
[[ego]] occurs when the child
is inducted into the symbolic order.
[[psychosis]], for Lacan, is
the state of being one falls into if this process of induction into the
symbolic fails and the subject is left stranded in the illusory world of
the imaginary.
