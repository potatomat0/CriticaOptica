[[situation]]

 A term introduced
by [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] in
*L'Être et le néant* (1943), translated as *Being and Nothingness*
(1958), to describe the
[[existentialism]] environment
in which every subject is immersed. The situation is the complex set of
circumstances that taken together form the condition of possibility in
which the subject must choose to act or not. [[Cultural Studies]] has adopted this
term, jettisoning its existential dimension, and used it to distinguish
between the opportunities and challenges faced by people in different
parts of the world, taking into account factors such as
[[class]],
[[gender]],
[[race]], and
[[sexuality]].
