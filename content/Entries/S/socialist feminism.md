[[socialist feminism]]

 A
synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and
[[Marxism]] (particularly its
New Left inflection) that challenges
[[feminism]]'s neglect of
[[class]] and the Left's
neglect of [[gender]].
Socialist feminism rejects radical feminism's central claim that
[[patriarchy]] is the sole
and universal source of the oppression of women, just as it rejects
Marxism's claim that
[[class]] and [[class struggle]] are the only
determining factors in understanding the present
[[situation]]. Socialist
feminism argues that class and gender are mutually reinforcing systems
of oppression (later critics of socialist feminism would add the
reminder that [[race]] must
also be taken into account). This is clear in the phrase 'women's work'
which designates a type of work that only women can or should do and at
the same time justifies the lowly pay scale assigned to it. Socialist
feminism does not share, therefore, [[Beauvoir, Simone de]]'s foundational
claim in *Le Deuxi√®me Sexe* (1949), translated as *The Second Sex*
(1952), that the transition to socialism predicted by [[historical materialism]] would in and of
itself free women from their subordination to men.
