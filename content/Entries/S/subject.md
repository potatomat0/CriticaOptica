[[subject]]

 A generic term
widely used in [[critical theory]] to designate what
used to be termed the individual or the self. The shift in language is
intended to signal the fact that in the face of the arguments by
critical theory, [[Marxism]],
and [[psychoanalysis]], the
idea of an autonomous individual able to think and act wholly according
to their own reason is insupportable. On the one hand, as psychoanalysis
shows, the fact of the
[[unconscious]] means that no
agent is fully conscious of all their acts, while on the other hand
Marxism shows that no agent is capable of determining the course of
history. The key implication of this, which is central to [[Cultural Studies]], is that the subject
is the product of the conjunction of history and the unconscious, and
not a naturally occurring or ready-made entity.
