[[Spivak, Gayatri]]
 (1942--)


Indian-born [[collocation]],
[[post-structuralism]],
[[Marxism]] literary critic
and theorist. The daughter of middle-class parents, she was born in
Calcutta at a time when India was still part of the British Empire.
Borrowing money, she moved to the US to attend graduate school at
Cornell, where she did comparative literature because that was the only
school to offer her a scholarship. She wrote her PhD on William Butler
Yeats, under the direction of Paul de Man. Her first job was at the
University of Iowa, which she started a full two years before her
dissertation was defended in 1967.
Around the same time she happened to read about a certain book by
[[Derrida, Jacques]], whom she
had not at that time heard of, and was so struck by it she decided to
translate it. That book was *De la grammatologie* (1967); her
translation of it as *Of Grammatology* (1974) literally changed her
life. She was suddenly propelled into the spotlight right at the moment
when [[deconstruction]] was
the height of intellectual fashion. Although she uses deconstructive
ideas and motifs in her work, Spivak is not a Derridean. Her work is
diverse in its outlook but concentrates on a handful of key problematics
underpinning what, in her magnum opus *A Critique of Postcolonial
Reason* (1999), she terms postcolonial reason, particularly agency,
identity, and subjectivity.
These three themes are brought together to stunning effect in what is
undoubtedly Spivak's best-known work, the 1988 essay 'Can the Subaltern
Speak?' (incorporated into *A Critique of Postcolonial Reason*), which
offers a powerful meditation on and theorization of the practice of
*sati* (the ritual immolation of widows). Spivak's answer to this vexed
question is quite straightforward: the
[[subaltern]] cannot speak
insofar as he/she remains a subaltern---by definition the subaltern is
politically mute, unable to voice their perspective on the way things
are and expect to be heard. But in true deconstructive fashion, she also
questions the possibility of the 'pure' voice of the subaltern. It is in
this context that she has argued that it is sometimes necessary to adopt
a stance she calls [[strategic essentialism]], as a means of
finding a speaking voice. In later works, she has admitted that this
essay is largely autobiographical; she has also amended her position
with regard to [[Deleuze, Gilles]]
and [[actual]] and softened
her often misdirected critiques of their work.
Not one to pull punches, Spivak has also written blistering critiques of
so-called French feminism, especially of [[Kristeva, Julia]], for the blithe
way it treats non-European others, placing it in a long line of western
appropriations of the East (the honourable exception in her view is
[[Cixous, Hélène]]). Mindful
of her comparatively privileged position and the necessary complicity
with the global capitalist system it entails, Spivak has used her status
to set up foundations in India to support literacy campaigns for
indigenous women. She has also translated a series of works by Indian
novelist Mahasweta Devi.

[Stanislavsky, Konstantin
Sergeyevich](#X601a1a3031173d28b4dc201eb5389f400fa4ee4) (1863--1938)
Russian theatre director, best known as the 'father' of so-called
'method acting' (Hollywood devotees include Marlon Brando, James Dean,
and Paul Newman). Born to a very wealthy family, Stanislavsky had a very
privileged upbringing. Incredibly, given his bourgeois background,
Stanislavsky survived both the revolutions of 1917 and Stalin's purges.
Although his family disapproved of acting as an occupation for their
son, it being considered too low class, they were wealthy enough to have
their own private theatre in which he could experiment. His access to
family money enabled him to establish first the Moscow Society for
Literature and then, more importantly, the Moscow Art Theatre, whose
touring performances to Europe and America were the real source of his
global influence. The Moscow Art Theatre staged works by many of the
leading lights of Russian literature, e.g. Isaac Babel, Mikhail
Bulgakov, Anton Chekhov, and Maxim Gorky. It is however for his
contribution to acting methodology that Stanislavsky is best known.
Several of his works are available in English, for example: *An Actor
Prepares* (1936), *Building a Character*, *Creating a Role* (1961), and
the autobiography *My Life in Art* (1925). Stanislavsky's 'method' or
'system', as it is variously known, teaches actors to 'live' their parts
either by calling on their own memories and experiences, or by
'inhabiting' the imagined world of their character. Stanislavsky
famously used to ask his actors to perform theatrical exercises and
games designed to estrange them as individual actors from their selves,
to better enable them to 'become' their characters. This naturalistic
style was explicitly rejected by [[Brecht, Bertolt]], but it is
virtually the standard mode in contemporary cinema. There is probably no
more influential theorist of theatre in the twentieth century.
