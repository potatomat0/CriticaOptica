[[singular universal]]

 French
philosopher [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s term for what it
is that sets apart great writers like Gustave Flaubert---they are the
singular instance of that which is universal. Sartre develops this
concept in his five-volume work on Flaubert *L'Idiot de la famille:
Gustave Flaubert de 1821 รก 1857* (1971), translated as *The Family
Idiot: Gustave Flaubert 1821--57* (1981), which begins with the
question: what can we know about a person? He argues that every detail
about a person's life, from the most mundane to the most momentous, is
at some deep level profoundly homogenous, which is to say all are parts
of a greater whole. Every person is a product of their history, Sartre
argues, and at the same time a producer of their own history; as a
result, the universal is always singular and the singular always
universal.
