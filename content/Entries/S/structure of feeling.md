[[structure of feeling]]
[[Williams, Raymond]] coined
this phrase in *Preface to Film* (1954) to discuss the relationship
between dramatic conventions and written texts. What concerned Williams
was the social acceptability of particular conventions---think of the
theme of mistaken identity which is rife in Shakespeare's plays which
without the benefit of special effects relies on convention for its
plausibility. In later works, particularly *The Long Revolution* (1961),
Williams would develop this concept further, using it to problematize
(though not refute) [[Gramsci, Antonio]]'s concept of
[[hegemony]]. Hegemony, which
can be thought of as either 'common sense' or the dominant way of
thinking in a particular time and place, can never be total, Williams
argued, there must always be an inner dynamic by means of which new
formations of thought emerge. Structure of feeling refers to the
different ways of thinking vying to emerge at any one time in history.
It appears in the gap between the official discourse of policy and
regulations, the popular response to official discourse and its
appropriation in literary and other cultural texts. Williams uses the
term feeling rather than thought to signal that what is at stake may not
yet be articulated in a fully worked-out form, but has rather to be
inferred by reading between the lines. If the term is vague it is
because it is used to name something that can really only be regarded as
a trajectory. It is this later formulation that is most widely known.
