[[Senghor, Léopold]]
(1906--2001) Senegalese poet and politician. Regarded by many as one of
the most important intellectuals in Africa in the twentieth century,
Senghor was the first president of Senegal, following its independence
from France. Prior to that he was, like his friend [[Césaire, Aimé]] (who represented
Martinique in the same period) Senegal's representative in the National
Assembly in France. Senghor met Césaire as a student in Paris. The two
of them, along with fellow student Léon Damas, from French Guiana,
founded the literary review *L'Étudiant noir* (The Black Student), which
was one of the first serials to give critical attention to black
writers. It was in the third issue of this journal that the word with
which his name would become most closely associated, namely
[[négritude]] (blackness),
was used. Coined by Césaire, but rapidly adopted by Senghor, *négritude*
is an early example of the strategy gay rights activists would later
deploy to good effect, the adoption of a negative or derogatory term and
its transformation into a positive. In 1948, Senghor compiled and edited
a volume of Francophone poetry called *Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie
nègre et malgache*, (Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry) which
was introduced by [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s now famous essay
'Orphée Noir' (Black Orpheus).
