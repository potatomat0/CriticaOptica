[[stream of consciousness]]

 A
continuous flow of sense-data (perceptions, thoughts, memories, and
sensations) produced in the mind without either self-censorship or
self-reflection. The concept was conceived by the American psychologist
William James (brother of the writers Henry and Alice James), but is
widely used in literary studies to describe a style of writing that
tries to emulate this particular state of mind. The key examples are
James Joyce's *Ulysses* (1922) and Virginia Woolf's *To the Lighthouse*
(1927). Ideally, writing of this type should give the reader the
impression they are witnessing thoughts as they are born, as though they
were somehow able to jack directly into another consciousness.
