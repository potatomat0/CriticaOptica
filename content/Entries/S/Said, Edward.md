[[Said, Edward]] 
(1935--2003)


Palestinian literary and cultural critic. One of the founding figures of
[[Postcolonial Studies]]. An
accomplished pianist, Said also wrote extensively on music. Outside the
academy, Said was a member of the Palestinian National Council (PNC)
from 1977 until 1991 (for which the FBI opened a file on him and kept
him under surveillance).
In his 1993 Reith Lectures on BBC Radio, later published as
*Representations of the Exile* (1994), Said described himself as an
exile, permanently displaced from his home, his homeland, and his
language. This sense of displacement was doubled, he said, by the fact
that he belonged to a people who were themselves dispossessed and
displaced. In his memoir *Out of Place* (1999), written between
treatments for the leukaemia that would claim his life at the early age
of 67, Said makes clear the extent to which his complicated origins as a
Palestinian are central to his thinking as a literary and cultural
critic.
Said was born in Jerusalem, then part of the British Mandate of
Palestine. His family was solidly middle-class, and at that time
actually lived in Cairo. His father was a businessman with American
citizenship and his mother a Nazarene Christian. Although primarily
based in Cairo, the family maintained a home in Talbiyah in West
Jerusalem until 1947, and Said lived 'between worlds'. Talbiyah was
incorporated into the State of Israel following the Arab-Israeli War in
1948.
In 1951 Said was sent to boarding school in the US. Thereafter he
completed a BA and MA at Princeton, followed by a PhD on Joseph Conrad
at Harvard, which was published in 1966 as *Joseph Conrad and the
Fiction of Autobiography*. A year before he completed his PhD, he was
appointed to a position in English and Comparative Literature at
Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his life.
Although Said's training as a literary critic was firmly [[New Criticism]]---he frequently
acknowledges the influence of R.P. Blackmur and Lionel Trilling---he was
among the first generation of US scholars to embrace critical theory.
His main theoretical interlocutors were [[Adorno, Theodor]] (particularly with
respect to music), [[Barthes, Roland]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Gramsci, Antonio]], and [[Foucault, Michel]]. This is
reflected in Said's second book, *Beginnings: Intention and Method*
(1975), which established him as part of the new wave of literary
critics (e.g. [[de Man, Paul]], [[Miller, J. Hillis]], and [[Spivak, Gayatri]]) who advanced
beyond, without necessarily leaving behind, the established critical
practice of 'close reading', and became known as practitioners of
[[theory]]. Said critiques
Derrida and Foucault, in particular, for being insufficiently worldly,
which is to say too focused on purely textual concerns and not attentive
enough to underpinning historical dynamics. *Beginnings* was in many
respects a transitional work for Said, for it was not until his third
book, *Orientalism: Western Conceptions of the Orient* (1978), that he
really found his true m√©tier and with it worldwide fame as one of the
originators of postcolonial theory.
[[Orientalism]], as Said
conceives it, is almost the complete opposite of the traditional meaning
of the term. In the strictest sense, Orientalism simply means any study
of or fascination with the Orient, which roughly speaking encompasses
North Africa, Turkey, the Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the
northern tip of India. Said's argument is that Orientalism's study of
the Orient conceives it as a monolithic, undifferentiated region; but,
more problematically, its conception of the Orient is utterly
phantasmal. As he points out, many of the most famous Orientalist
scholars never travelled to the Orient, and those who did arrived and
departed with all their preconceptions and prejudices intact. He argued
that this cultural blindness is an artefact of the discrepant power
between the Orientalists (largely from European nations) and the Orient
(largely under the rule of European colonial powers). Unsurprisingly,
this thesis has its critics (notably [[Gellner, Ernest]], Bernard Lewis,
and Aijaz Ahmad), and it even divides opinion among those who basically
support it. Nonetheless, as a way of thinking about the relation between
culture and power, it has been enormously influential. *Culture and
Imperialism* (1993) furnishes the sequel to *Orientalism*, extending its
claims to literatures the other work did not consider.
In the years following the publication of *Orientalism*, Said immersed
himself in Palestinian politics and wrote a series of articles and books
describing the situation of the Palestinian people and decrying the
politics that had put them in that situation: *The Question of
Palestine* (1979), *Covering Islam: How the Media and Experts Determine
how We See the Rest of the World* (1981), and an edited collection
entitled *Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian
Question* (1988). Said favoured a two-state solution and he resigned
from the PNC in 1991 when it became clear in the lead up to the Oslo
Accords that this was not on the agenda. After 1991, he wrote several
more books on Palestine, including *The Politics of Dispossession*
(1994), *Peace and its Discontents* (1996), and *From Oslo to Iraq and
the Road Map* (2003).
The last decade of Said's life was amazingly productive. Acutely aware
of his limited time, Said granted several book-length interviews in this
period which offer terrific insights into his life and work. He also
devoted time to his other great passion, music. He wrote a column for
*The Nation* (a selection of these pieces has been published as *Music at the Limits* (2007), and gave the Wellek Library lectures on this
topic as well, published as *Musical Elaborations* (1991). More
concretely, he collaborated with Daniel Barenboim to create the
West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which attempted to bridge the
Israel/Palestine divide by means of cultural cooperation. It remains an
important legacy of his work, as the orchestra continues to play and
continues to defy Israeli authorities by performing in the West Bank.
His last, unfinished, book fittingly enough, was *On Late Style: Music
and Literature against the Grain* (2006). 'Late style' is Said's term
for the aesthetic that develops when an artist knows they have made it
career-wise, that their reputation is secure, and that they can relax
enough to permit themselves to experiment.
