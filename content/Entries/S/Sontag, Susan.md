[[Sontag, Susan]] 
(1933--2004)


American literary and cultural critic. Born in New York City, but raised
in Tucson and Los Angeles, Sontag gained a BA from the University of
Chicago. She did graduate work at Harvard, Oxford, and the Sorbonne, but
never completed a higher degree. She taught briefly at Columbia
University, but for most of her life she lived by her writing. Her essay
'Notes on Camp' (1964), which first appeared in *The New York Review of
Books* and was later included in her landmark collection *Against Interpretation* (1966), caused a sensation, propelling her into literary
stardom and the role of public intellectual. For many, this essay
defined the sensibility of the 1960s. Similarly, the title essay of
*Against Interpretation* resonated strongly with the literary critical
[[zeitgeist]], which was then
moving rapidly towards
[[postmodernism]]. Sontag's
essay celebrated what art could not say, its silences, as the highest
form of what art could achieve; she also insisted that art should
primarily be thought of as an experience, and that this was beyond
interpretation. For this reason, Sontag championed a number of European
writers, such as [[Benjamin, Walter]], [[Barthes, Roland]], and [[Artaud, Antonin]], bringing their
work to the attention of Anglophone readers. Like Barthes, Sontag had a
profound interest in the visual image, particularly the photograph. Her
book-length essay *On Photography* (1977) is still a touchstone for
media studies today. In the 1970s, Sontag was diagnosed with breast
cancer. Chronicling the way cancer changes how the sufferer is perceived
by society, Sontag wrote two powerful books on the cultural construction
of disease, *Illness as Metaphor* (1978) and *AIDS and its Metaphors*
(1988). Combining her interest in illness and photography, she wrote an
affecting response to 9/11 and the march to war that followed entitled
*Regarding the Pain of Others* (2003). In her final years, she lived
with celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, who chronicled her illness
and even her death in pictures. She died in 2004 shortly after the
massive Indian Ocean tsunami which killed more than a quarter of a
million people, effectively denying her the front-page farewell she
might well have otherwise had, but also in a way proving her thesis
about the power of images. She was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery in
Paris.
