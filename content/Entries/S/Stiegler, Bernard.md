[[Stiegler, Bernard]]
 (1952--)


French philosopher of technology and society. Before becoming a
philosopher, Stiegler led a colourful life, which included a period of
incarceration for armed robbery between 1978 and 1983. As he recounts in
his autobiography, *Passer à l'acte* (2003), translated as *Acting Out*
(2009), it was during this period that he became interested in
philosophy. He went on to complete a PhD at the
École des Hautes
Études en Sciences Sociales
([[ISA]]) in 1992. An
incredibly prolific author, Stiegler has written many books, the best
known of which are: *Technics and Time* (three volumes, 1994--2001),
*Symbolic Misery* (two volumes, 2004--2005), and *Échographies de la
télévision* (with Jacques Derrida, 1996). He is best known for his
development of the concept of
[[technics]], which he adapts
from the work of both [[Heidegger, Martin]] and [[Simondon, Gilbert]].
