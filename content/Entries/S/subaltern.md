[[subaltern]]

 A term conceived
by the Italian Marxist [[Gramsci, Antonio]], who because he
was in prison and his writings subject to censorship used it as a
codeword for any class of people (but especially peasants and workers)
subject to the [[hegemony]]
of another more powerful class. The term has been adopted by a group of
[[Postcolonial Studies]]
scholars, thus forming a sub-discipline within the field known as
Subaltern Studies. The group was founded by South East Asian historian,
Ranajit Guha and over time it has included such scholars as [[Bhabha, Homi]], [[Spivak, Gayatri]], Partha Chatterjee,
and Dipesh Chakrabarty. Its aim, following Gramsci's precepts, is to
examine the formation of subaltern classes in a variety of settings in
South East Asia, but principally India and its near neighbours, with the
aim of providing a kind of counter-history, to address the imbalances of
'official' histories, which tend to focus exclusively on the affairs of
the state and the ruling class. Spivak's famous essay 'Can the Subaltern
Speak?' (incorporated into *A Critique of Postcolonial Reason* (1999),
problematizes the key premise of Subaltern Studies, namely that the
heterogeneous group of peoples classified as subaltern can in fact have
sufficient unity such that 'they' can speak. Her answer to her own
question is a resolute no. The term has also been used in Latin American
studies to similar purpose, though there it is given a slightly
different slant: it also refers to the habit or mindset of servitude and
subservience that needs to be overcome in order to bring about political
change.
