[[sublimation]]

 The
transformation of the sexual instincts towards non-sexual ends. [[Freud, Sigmund]] proposes this
concept as an explanation for how it is possible for all human activity
to be driven by the libido and for there to be a wide range of
activities not obviously sexual in nature. Indeed, Freud will go so far
as to say that civilization itself is a steady process of the
sublimation of the sexual instincts. His principle example of
sublimation is art: art, Freud argues, is a result of the sublimation of
the artist's libidinal energy. What Freud does not properly explain,
however, is the mechanism by which this process of sublimation takes
place. For this reason, although the concept is widely referred to by
Freud, in contemporary
[[psychoanalysis]] it is
usually treated with scepticism. [[Lacan, Jacques]] uses the concept of
sublimation in his work only in a highly modified form.
