[[society]]

 An abstract term
for the complex set of beliefs,
[[practices]], rules, and
traditions groups of people adhere to. Society is always greater than a
single individual, and as such it is often defined in the negative as
the opposite of the individual, or as that which constrains the
individual and prevents him or her from living out their
[[desire]]. But it is also
used in more affirmative terms to classify the ensemble of institutions,
organizations, and relationships that give support to the individual. It
is often contrasted with
[[culture]], with the
implication that society is the form to culture's content---it is
organized and organizing, whereas culture is not. To put it another way,
society speaks in the imperative, whereas culture uses the
interrogative.
