[[sympoiesis]] 

[[Haraway, Donna]] 's replacement
term for Maturana and Varela's concept of
[[autopoiesis]], which she
objects to on the grounds that no 'thing' makes itself. It is worth
noting that this is something of a misreading of Maturana and Varela,
since they do not claim that the autopoietic machine, as they call it,
produces itself. It would be more accurate to say that autopoiesis
refers to a process of self-reproduction. Nonetheless, as Haraway
defines it in *Staying with Trouble* (2016), adapting the work of Beth
Dempster who coined the phrase, sympoeisis refers to a process of
'making with'---i.e. it does not refer to a self that makes itself, but
rather a form of self-making that can only happen collectively and
collaboratively.
