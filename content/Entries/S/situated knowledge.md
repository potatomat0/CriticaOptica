[[situated knowledge]]

 A
concept devised by [[Haraway, Donna]] in response to two
[[epistemological break]] trends in
[[critical theory]],
particularly in [[feminism]]:
the first, which is generally attributed to
[[postmodernism]] and/or
[[post-structuralism]], is
the relativist idea that there are no absolute forms of knowledge; the
second, generally attributed to
[[empiricism]], is the
realist idea that there are only absolute forms of knowledge. Both these
positions are problematic in Haraway's view: the first, because it rules
out the possibility of calling anything to account because one cannot
say with certainty that a particular thing or event exists or happened;
the second, because it demands objective verification, i.e. a form of
verification that is somehow independent of all human subjectivity. As
Haraway's work shows, both of these positions are untenable---she
classifies them as 'god-tricks'. Situated knowledge occupies the middle
ground between these two extremes: it is at once historically
contingent, deeply subjective, aware of its own meaning-making
capabilities and potentialities, and committed to a faithful,
no-nonsense (as Haraway puts it) account of the real world. Rather than
trying to systematize the world and parcel it up and represent it as a
machine, situated knowledge conceives the world as an earth-wide network
of active connections and partial truths. Fundamental to the notion of
situated knowledge is the idea that the world is active: it is not
simply there waiting to be mapped.
