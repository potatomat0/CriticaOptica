[[shifter]]

 A class of words
whose meaning can only be fully determined in the context of a specific
message between a sender and a receiver. Also known as
[[deictic]], shifters are
words like 'I' or 'this' whose meaning varies according to context
because their principal function is connective rather than semantic. The
Russian linguist [[Jakobson, Roman]] was the first
person to use the concept of shifter.
