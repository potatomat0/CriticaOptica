[[symbolic violence]] 

[[Bourdieu, Pierre]] 's term for the
process whereby the dominant social class impose their
[[ideology]] on the dominated
classes. To put it another way, it theorizes the form
[[hegemony]] takes when it is
achieved. The dominant class legitimizes its own class interests in the
eyes of the dominated classes by giving them the appearance of the
naturally right.
