[[space]]

 At once the container
of [[everyday life]] (i.e.
where we live) and an active agent in it (a social-acting force). An
incredibly wide-reaching term, with complex and even contradictory
points of reference, it can refer to either the physical environment
(built and natural) on its own or the physical environment as it is
inhabited by defined groups of people, or both. Similarly, it can range
in scale from the personal to the planetary. It is conceived differently
by several different disciplines, each one emphasizing one or more of
its facets---e.g. architecture, [[Cultural Studies]], geography, history,
sociology, planning, and urbanism---thus lending itself to an
interdisciplinary approach.
French [[Marxism]]
sociologist [[Lefebvre, Henri]] is undoubtedly
the most influential theorist of space in the twentieth century. His
distinction between perceived space, conceived space, and lived
space---i.e. space as we see it (but also touch it, feel it, and so on),
space as we design and build it, and space as something we relate to in
an emotional and affective way---captures the principal ways in which
space has been thought about in the past century. Visual artists have
tended to foreground perceived space, architects and urbanists have
tended to focus on conceived space, with cultural studies, geography,
and sociology claiming lived space as their own. But as Lefebvre
insists, these three types of space can only be separated in the
abstract and the real task of spatial thinking is to try to think of the
three facets of space together. American geographer [[Soja, Edward]] refers to this
process as trialectics and his work offers several interesting examples
of how this can be made to work.
The other major theorists of space in the twentieth century who have had
a major influence on the field are: [[Bachelard, Gaston]], [[Blanchot, Maurice]], [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]], [[Certeau, Michel de]] and [[Augé, Marc]]. Michel de Certeau
opposed space to place, defining the latter as what space becomes
through the investment of power. By implication, space is the preserve
of the powerless according to Certeau; those who dwell in space rather
than place are forced to use
[[tactics]] against
[[strategy]]. Drawing on
Certeau's work, Marc Augé created the concept of the
[[non-place]], which he also
opposed to place: the non-place is a place invested by power that does
not confer any of the benefits of place (such as belonging or
locatedness)---his examples include subway systems, airports, and so on.
In his highly influential synopsis of
[[postmodernism]], [[Jameson, Fredric]] argues that in the
post World War II era there has been a mutation in the spatial
environment. Drawing on Lefebvre, he foregrounds the fact that since
1945 there has been a massive demographic shift away from the country to
the city, with the result that by the end of the century for the first
time in human history more people live in cities than the country. But
he also observes that in the West at least there has been a move towards
creating structures that are self-contained, that seem to want to stand
apart from the rest of the city, as though they were mini-worlds. His
case in point, the Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, has become
since his discussion of it a key
[[topos]] of postmodernity.
