[[Socialism]]

 or Barbarism
(Socialisme ou Barbarie) A political group so-called because of the
journal they established of the same name, which ran for 40 issues.
Formed in response to Tito's break with Stalin in 1948 by a breakaway
group from the Trotskyist Parti Communiste Internationaliste which
included [[Castoriadis, Cornelius]], [[Debord, Guy]], Claude Lefort, and
[[Lyotard, Jean-François]],
Socialism or Barbarism was essentially
[[Marxism]] in its outlook
yet, paradoxically, broke with virtually every major tenet of Marxism in
the course of its nearly two decades of effective life. The group's name
was taken from a line by Rosa Luxembourg and reflected the conviction
that a third world war was inevitable, and following that the choice
would be between socialism or barbarism, and that it was necessary to
begin preparing for that moment. The group folded in 1965 because
internal tensions reached such a high point it became impossible to
continue. During its lifespan the membership of the group never rose
above 100, but its influence was felt more widely than that number
suggests. The group's two main theorists were Castoriadis and Lefort,
both of whom also wrote under pseudonyms (Pierre Chaulieu and Claude
Montal respectively). Anti-Stalinist in its outlook, the group was
against all forms of bureaucracy and favoured worker-led councils
instead. It agitated in factories, particularly the Renault factory in
Billancourt which would be at the centre of the events of [[May ’68]], although it never had
more than a few members who were actually blue-collar workers. Its peak
period was in the early 1950s following Stalin's death when both the
Korean War and the war in Algeria gave fresh impetus to the group's
aims. Interestingly, although Castoriadis tried to revive the group
following May '68 it proved impossible. Influential in its time, the
group has faded from view, largely because its economic prognoses have
not panned out.
