[[syntagm]]

 Used in both
linguistics and [[semiotics]]
to theorize the possible (i.e. meaningful) combinations of
[[pragmatics]] elements.
The syntagm is the deep structure of a sentence or phrase which remains
unchanged even if its specific elements are changed. For example, there
is no difference at the level of the syntagm between 'the boy went to
the shop' and 'the girl went to the shop' because in both cases the
structure 'a person went somewhere' is preserved. The syntagm is in
effect the horizontal axis of communication, while the paradigm is the
vertical axis.
