[[seriality]]

 French
philosopher [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s term for an
ensemble of individuals who have nothing more in common than what they
are presently doing, such as people standing in line to go to a cinema.
The opposite of a group, the individuals in a series are
[[displacement]] from one
another. A crucial concept in *Critique of Dialectical Reason* (1976),
seriality designates a state of affairs that politics ought to try to
overcome.
