[[structural causality]]
Derived from Baruch Spinoza's conception of God as the immanent cause of
all things, [[Althusser, Louis]] used this term
to characterize the causal relationship between abstract entities like
the social totality and concrete entities such as economic, political,
and ideological institutions (e.g. banks, political parties, and
schools). The structure is thus said to be immanent in its effects,
which means it only exists in its effects and therefore cannot be
separated from its effects. It is for this reason also defined as an
absent cause because it is nowhere present in and of itself as an actual
element. The most straightforward example of this is the notion of the
universe: it is literally everywhere, but can in no way be separated out
as a singular entity. Similarly, one can say we live in society, but the
abstract entity 'society' is nowhere in evidence. Applied to God, as in
Spinoza's thought, this notion was seen as heretical by Spinoza's peers
because it denied the idea of a transcendental God distinct from His
creation. In *The Political Unconscious* (1981), [[Jameson, Fredric]] shows that the
idea of structural causality can be mobilized to develop political
readings of cultural texts by treating the economy in the fullest sense
of the word as an absent cause. *See also* [ideological state
