[[screen memory]]
**(*Deckerinnerung*)** A childhood memory that is paradoxically vivid
and inconsequential. Because of the apparent banality of these memories
there does not seem to be any reason for them to be preserved in the
memory, a fact that
[[psychoanalysis]] latches on
to as an important clue to their deeper importance. [[Freud, Sigmund]] theorized that such
memories are compromise formations, or symptoms, like
[[parapraxis]], meaning they
function to disguise or conceal a trauma of some kind, usually of a
sexual nature.
