[[strategy]]

 and tactics
[[Certeau, Michel de]]
proposed that these terms (which he adapted from the work of the German
war theorist Karl von Clausewitz) could be used to analyse what he
termed the [[practices]] of
[[everyday life]]. Strategy
and tactics are defined as different types of calculations: strategy is
the kind of calculation one can make when one is in control of all the
variables, whereas tactics is the kind of calculation one must make when
one is not in control of all the variables. For Certeau, the
[[panopticon]] is the most
fully realized example of strategy, but contra [[Foucault, Michel]] he did not regard
its power to control the behaviour of inmates to be absolute. Indeed, he
praised the inventiveness of inmates in circumventing surveillance and
maintaining a semblance of autonomy and used the term tactics to
describe their various subterfuges. Tactics, then, is what one can do in
spite of the fact that one lacks the power to control one's environment.
It is an ambivalent term and though it has been used to describe
[[resistance]] to power (by
John Fiske, among others), it is more accurately seen as an
accommodation to a situation that cannot easily be changed.
