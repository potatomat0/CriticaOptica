[[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis]]

 A
now discredited theory of language which holds that linguistic
competence determines cognitive capacity. Developed by American linguist
Edmund Sapir and his student Benjamin Whorf, using a study of Native
American languages as its baseline, this theory holds that the relative
complexity of a language---what it is able to say---determines the limit
of what those language speakers are able to know. Moreover, each
language is born of a different world-view, so it is impossible for
speakers from different language groups to ever properly come to know
one another. In effect it makes an absolute of the idea of cultural
relativism widely embraced by both [[Cultural Studies]] and [[Postcolonial Studies]].
