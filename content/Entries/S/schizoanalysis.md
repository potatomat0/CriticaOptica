[[schizoanalysis]]

[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]]

's term for their
project of re-engineering
[[psychoanalysis]] by (i)
repolarizing it around
[[psychosis]] rather than
[[neurosis]] and (ii)
aligning it with [[Marxism]]
by finding a true point of commonality between the respective
[[discourse]]. The word
first appears in Deleuze and Guattari's first collaborative effort,
*L'Anti-Œdipe* (1972), translated as *Anti-Oedipus* (1977), and recurs
in their subsequent books, *Kafka: Pour une littérature mineure* (1975),
translated as *Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature* (1986), and *Mille Plateaux* (1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987), but,
interestingly enough, does not appear in their final collaborative work
*Qu'est-ce que la philosophie?* (1991), translated as *What is
Philosophy?* (1994). In *Anti-Oedipus* Deleuze and Guattari specify that
the project of creating schizoanalysis involves three tasks---one
negative and two positive. The negative task is the setting aside of
those aspects of psychoanalysis which in their view do not work---this
is not as straightforward as simply jettisoning the concepts of the
[[id]],
[[ego]], and
[[superego]] because Deleuze
and Guattari are prepared to say that psychoanalysis works perfectly
insofar as it is only a matter of dealing with neuroses, but the problem
is that neuroses are a second order problem, meaning that---contrary to
[[Freud, Anna]]---they do not tell
us anything essential about the operation of the
[[unconscious]]. Deleuze and
Guattari argue that the unconscious is schizophrenic at its core but
machine-like in its processes, which they refer to as
[[desiring-production]], and
that in its day-to-day operations it creates
[[desiring-machine]] which
combine with one another to produce the assemblage known as the
[[subject]]. The two positive
tasks are: first, discover in a subject the nature, formation, and
function of their desiring-machines; second, separate the psychic
investments of desire from the psychic investments of interest. These
three tasks are predicated on the following four theses:
(i) every libidinal investment of the unconscious is social (not
personal) and therefore bears upon a historical field;
(ii) there are two types of unconscious libidinal investment---desire
and interest;
(iii) the non-familial (or psychotic) unconscious libidinal
investments have priority over the familial (or neurotic) investments;
(iv) the unconscious libidinal investments of desire have two
modes---paranoid and utopian. Schizoanalysis cannot be considered a
completed project: it must continue to adapt and change to keep in step
with the changing times.
