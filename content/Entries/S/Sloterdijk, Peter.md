[[Sloterdijk, Peter]]
 (1947--)


German cultural critic and philosopher. Born in Karlsruhe, he studied
philosophy at the University of Munich, and completed a PhD at the
University of Hamburg in 1975. He came into prominence with the
publication of *Kritik der zynischen Vernunft* (1983), translated as
*The Critique of Cynical Reason* (1987), which was a surprise
bestseller, retailing over 40,000 copies in just a few months (for an
academic book, this is virtually unheard of). His thesis, buried beneath
five hundred odd pages about Weimar Germany, is that we have reached the
end of the period in which understanding or
[[Enlightenment]] can prompt
social action. This rather provocative idea struck a chord with
academics, social critics, and activists alike, who similarly were
discouraged by the failure of various social change projects. Since then
he has published prolifically on a wide range of subjects. His main
work, though, has been his trilogy *Sph√§ren* (Spheres) (1998--2004),
which tries to present a kind of unified field theory of the
co-existence of humans with all other things on the planet. In 2002 he
became co-host of the German cultural affairs TV programme *Das Philosophische Quartett*.
