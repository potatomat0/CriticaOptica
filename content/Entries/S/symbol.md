[[symbol]]

 **1.** A specific
type of [[representamen]] in
[[Peirce, Charles Sanders]]'s
[[semiotics]] model, which he
contrasts with the [[icon]]
and the [[docs/index]]. Peirce
defines the symbol as conventional because the relation between it and
its object is governed by an external law (e.g. the word 'give' has only
a conventional connection to the actions it describes).
**2.** Swiss analytical psychologist [[Jung, Carl]] used the concept of
symbol to denote an intuitive idea unable to be formulated in words. As
such, symbols generally appear as an impediment in therapy, as a moment
when it feels as though there is more to be said but somehow the words
are missing. They are effectively unconscious answers to conscious
questions. Symbols step in to articulate what cannot otherwise be
verbalized. The content of symbols---e.g. the rose as a symbol of
love---should not be viewed as fixed; rather it changes according to the
requirements of a particular idea. In doing so, however, it draws on and
reworks existing imagery. Symbols captivate the imagination and compel
us to attend to alternative perspectives. They are indistinct,
enigmatic, even metaphoric, presentations of our own psychic reality.
**3.** In aesthetics, including literary studies, a symbol is a
conventional image or
[[trope]] (e.g. the use of
the rose motif to signify love, or the cross to signify sacrifice).
Ernest Cassirer and [[Frye, Northrop]] are the main names
associated with this branch of aesthetics.
