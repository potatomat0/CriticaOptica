[[sovereignty]]

 A form of
[[authority]]. Its principal
characteristic is that it is the supreme or final authority, meaning
that there is no other form of authority surpassing it. Sovereignty has
taken a number of different forms throughout history, ranging from the
tribal chief to feudal king and democratically elected president. The
key political and theoretical problem it raises is the question of
legitimacy: sovereignty is never purely intrinsic, or naturally
occurring, it must be embedded in a social structure that serves as its
condition of possibility. For instance, feudal kings ruled by virtue of
their lineage and divine right. Ultimately, sovereignty can be seen as
an issue of who has the right to rule and how that right is vested.
