[[suture]]

 A term used in both
[[psychoanalysis]] and film
studies, where its use is in any case adapted from psychoanalysis, to
refer to the way like and unlike can be 'stitched' together. French
psychoanalyst [[Lacan, Jacques]] used the term to
signify the relationship between the conscious and the
[[unconscious]]. However, it
is really film studies, initiated by a 1977 essay in *Screen* by
Jean-Pierre Oudart, which has given the most attention to this concept.
Oudart suggested that cinema deploys a number of techniques to suture
its audience to what is happening on screen, and more particularly to
enable them to understand a narrative composed of images not words. The
best known of these is the shot/reverse shot typical of TV interviews
and practically any emotional encounter on screen: first we see the face
of the speaker, then we see the face of the listener, enabling us to see
their reaction to the other person's words. This change in perspective
gives the spectator the feeling that they are in fact standing in
the---now off screen---position of the speaker, thus suturing them into
the action on screen by making their own position outside of the screen
seem like a part of the greater totality of the action. The term has
fallen out of use in recent years, but it remains significant for
stimulating debate about the relationship between film and its audience.
