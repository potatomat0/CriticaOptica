[[semiotics]]

 The science of
[[sign]], as one of the
founders of the field Swiss linguist [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] famously put it.
There are two main schools of semiotics, Saussurean and Peircean, the
latter referring to the work of American
[[pragmatics]] philosopher
[[Peirce, Charles Sanders]].
The two semiotic models, which were constructed independently of one
another, differ in one important respect: whereas Saussure's model of
the sign is binary, Peirce's is tripartite. Unfortunately, with a
handful of exceptions, there has been little cross-fertilization between
the two schools of thought.
Saussure's key insight is that the sound of a word is arbitrary with
respect to both its meaning and the thing to which it ultimately refers:
there is no intrinsic reason, for example, that a cow should be called a
'cow' and that the word should be sounded in the way it is (that
different languages have different words for the same thing is taken as
proof of this latter point). On Saussure's view of things, the word
'cow' is more usefully understood as a sign consisting of a signifier
(the sound of the word) and a signified (the concept we associate with
that sound) and he extends this idea to the whole of language. More than
five decades after Saussure died, in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly
(but not exclusively) in France, linguists, literary theorists, cultural
critics, and psychoanalysts, like [[Barthes, Roland]], [[LÃ©vi-Strauss, Claude]], [[Metz, Christian]], and [[Lacan, Jacques]], began to experiment
with Saussure's notion of the sign and found that it could be extended
to a great range of meaning-making activities, including the
non-linguistic realms of [[everyday life]]. This led to a
veritable explosion of interest in semiotics and for a number of years
it was the dominant mode of analysis in the humanities, particularly in
[[Cultural Studies]] which
saw semiotics as a means of theorizing how
[[ideology]] works. The
pioneer in this respect was Roland Barthes, whose work on
[[myth]], showed that even
the most ordinary of objects, such as soap bubbles, convey significance
beyond mere utility (they can be a sign of purity, joy, cleanliness,
childhood fun, and so on). As critics have since pointed out, however,
the price of this has been to treat every cultural activity as being
'like a language' and while this has been a powerfully effective model
to follow it does have drawbacks, inasmuch that not every cultural
activity performs like a language. Since its heyday in the 1960s,
semiotics has become a specialist and highly sophisticated area of study
which has found a new audience amongst artificial intelligence
researchers.
Peirce's model of the sign consists of three basic elements: the sign,
the object, and the interpretant. A sign, he said, is anything that can
be determined as such by another element, namely the object, which in
turn has an effect on a person, i.e. the interpretant. Signs do not
simply exist: they must be produced. Thus, anything can be a sign, but
not everything automatically is a sign. By the same token, whatever is a
sign is not a sign forever. Thus, red is a sign of communism (object)
only for as long as there are people who remember that it is
(interpretants). But it can also be a sign of danger (object) because
'we' (interpretants) have been trained to see it as such. The second way
of thinking about the sign red does not cancel out the first, but adds
to it. In this way a sign can become an object to another sign and so on
to infinity.
Peircean semiotics has been much less influential than the Saussurian
mode, but it has not been without its adherents. It has been important
to the work of [[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[Eco, Umberto]], and [[Kristeva, Julia]].
