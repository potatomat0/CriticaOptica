[[Shklovsky, Viktor]]
(1893--1984) Russian literary theorist and founder of
[[Opoyaz]], one of the two
groups (the other was the [*Moscow Linguistic
Circle](#Xb9ac6172d35e4f32200b602490fa36f0e7129e3)) which combined to
give rise to [[Russian Formalism]]. Born in St
Petersburg, he attended St Petersburg University, and then entered the
army. He fought in World War I, recording his experiences in a memoir,
*Sentimental'noe puteshestvie, vospominaniia* (1923), translated as *A Sentimental Journey: Memoirs, 1917--22* (1970). A prolific author,
Shklovsky wrote studies of Laurence Sterne, Maxim Gorky, and Leo
Tolstoy, as well as several semi-autobiographical works. He is best
known though for his invention of the concept of
[[ostranenie]]
('defamiliarization' or 'estrangement'), central to so much of the work
of the Russian Formalists. A neologism, it implies two kinds of actions:
making strange, and pushing aside. Shklovsky's best-known work, which is
also one of the best accounts of ostranenie available, is *O teorii
prozy* (1929), translated as *Theory of Prose* (1990). Sections of it,
especially the key essay 'Art as device', were translated in the 1970s,
and circulated very widely.
