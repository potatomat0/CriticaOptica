[[semanalysis]] 

[[Kristeva, Julia]]'s attempt in *The Revolution in Poetic Language* (1984) 
 to fuse
[[semiotics]] and
[[psychoanalysis]] so as to
produce a method of analysis capable of simultaneously comprehending the
process of the formation of texts and the process of deciphering texts.
It was intended to transcend the limitations of the Hegelian
[[dialectic]] and provide a
method that was genuinely materialist and at the same time able to deal
with what she would term
[[abject]], the
unrepresentable excess semiotics overlooks. Although a rich synthesis of
[[post-structuralism]]
methodologies and ideas, semanalysis was in many respects a failed
experiment and Kristeva soon abandoned it herself. Her later work does
not use the term at all. However, out of the project of developing
semanalysis arose the concept of
[[intertextuality]], which
has become a bedrock concept in [[critical theory]].
