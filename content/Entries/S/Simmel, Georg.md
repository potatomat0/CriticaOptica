[[Simmel, Georg]] 
(1858--1918)


German philosopher and one of the founding figures of social research
and [[critical theory]].
Simmel was a prolific author of more than twenty-five books, and a
direct influence on one of the most important schools of thought of the
twentieth century, namely the [[Frankfurt School]]. [[Habermas, Jürgen]] acknowledged him
as an important diagnostician of contemporary society, but Talcott
Parsons thought his work lacked a clear methodology so he excluded him
from his canon of great thinkers of the twentieth century.
Simmel was born in Berlin and lived most of his life there, witnessing
the city's growth from provincial capital to an industrialized
metropolis. Berlin was a touchstone for much of Simmel's writing,
particularly his most famous essay 'Die Großstädte und das Geistesleben'
(1903), translated as 'The Metropolis and Mental Life' (1948). In spite
of his international renown and an illustrious group of friends and
correspondents---Stefan George, Rainer Maria Rilke, Auguste Rodin,
[[Husserl, Edmund]], and [[Weber, Max]]---Simmel was, for
most of his professional life, a somewhat marginal figure. However, his
failure to advance professionally was cushioned to a great degree by the
fact that he was able to support himself with an inheritance.
Simmel commenced his studies at Berlin University in 1876, first in
history, then psychology (where he was taught by Moritz Lazarus, who
also taught [[Dilthey, Wilhelm]]), and finally
philosophy. In 1885 he was given a post at Berlin University, which he
held until 1900. He remained untenured for fifteen years, partly because
of his Jewishness, partly because he failed to secure the support needed
from powerful colleagues to advance, but mostly because sociology did
not then have the recognition and legitimacy it does today. Simmel was,
however, very popular with students (among them [[Bloch, Ernst]]) and was one of the
first to admit women into his classes (long before this became
officially possible in 1908). Simmel finally succeeded in obtaining a
full chair in philosophy at Strasbourg University shortly before the
outbreak of World War I in 1914. He remained there until his death in
1918.
The essential structure of Simmel's system of thought is set out in two
books generally referred to as the 'major' and the 'minor' sociologies:
the first, consisting of essays begun in the 1890s and completed in
1908, totalling over 1,000 pages (hence the designation 'major'), is
*Soziologie: Untersuchungen über die Formen Vergesellschaftung* (1908),
partially translated as *Sociology: Inquiries into the Construction of
Social Forms* (2009); the second, completed a decade later, is
*Grundfragen der Soziologie (Individuum und Gesellschaft)* (1917),
translated as *Fundamental Problems of Sociology (Individual and
Society)* (1950). These two works map out three broad areas of inquiry:
sociology's presuppositions; the relation between individual and society
viewed from the standpoint of either the individual or society; and the
development of social forms.
At first glance, Simmel's work appears to cover an utterly eclectic
range of topics, but there is a clear undercurrent of interest in the
singular problematic he referred to as the 'double relationship' between
the individual and society: on the one hand, the individual belongs to
society as a whole and is part of that, but on the other hand as an
individual he or she stands opposed to it. At the centre of Simmel's
conception of society is the concept of 'interaction', specifically the
interaction between individuals and society. But for Simmel this should
not be understood as the interaction between pre-existing entities (as
in [[Durkheim, Émile]]'s
work); on the contrary, the interaction is itself productive. He goes so
far as to say that one should not really speak of society, as such,
because that just refers to a collection of individuals. Instead one
should speak of 'sociation' (*Vergesellschaftung*), i.e. a
society-producing process.
Simmel's work hinges on the distinction he develops between form in the
abstract and content in the particular in a cultural setting. By form,
Simmel meant the patterned ways people interact with each other and
structure their [[everyday life]], which provides the
material for what he considered to be content. For Simmel, content is
essentially unavailable to us except through the lens of forms, which
are the functional equivalent of Immanuel Kant's categories. Forms give
content a determinate and determining existence. For instance, music is
a cultural form that has evolved from an actual set of practices into a
virtual entity by which we judge sound to be either sheer noise or
something aesthetically interesting.
The four basic principles underpinning Simmel's method are: (i) the
world consists of a bewildering variety of contents given shape by a
limited number of forms; (ii) the meaning of events and objects only
emerges through their interaction with other events and objects; (iii)
the properties of forms and the meanings of objects are a function of
the distance we are able to interpose between ourselves and the
respective forms and objects; (iv) the world is best understood as a
series of conflicts between contrasting categories. These principles are
vividly evident in Simmel's best-known and arguably most important work
*Philosophie des Geldes* (1900), translated as *The Philosophy of Money*
(1978). This work divided his contemporaries: it was greatly admired by
[[Lukács, György]] and roundly
criticized by [[Durkheim, Émile]]. [[Kracauer, Siegfried]] wrote (but never
published in full) an appreciative study of it after Simmel's death.
