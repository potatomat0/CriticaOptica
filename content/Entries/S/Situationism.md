[[Situationism]]

 A small,
influential and highly politicized artistic movement founded in 1957,
from the remnants of two previous
[[avant-garde]] groups, the
Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus (led by Asger Jorn, who had also been
involved in [[COBRA]]) and
the Lettrist International (founded in 1946 by Isidore Isou, an early
influence on [[Debord, Guy]]).
After an illustrious but tumultuous decade and a half it dissolved in 1972. *Internationale Situationniste*, the group's journal and principal
means of disseminating its ideas, published the first of its twelve
issues in 1958 and its last in 1969. Long out of print, the full run is
now available in English translation on the Internet.
The name of the group as well as the philosophy underpinning it derives
from [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s
concept of the [[situation]]
read as an answer to [[Lefebvre, Henri]]'s injunction in
his critiques of [[everyday life]] that change can only be
radical if it is engineered at a grassroots level. Creating new and
surprising situations through art was its means of challenging the
orthodoxy of everyday life and countering its
[[alienation]] (in
[[Marxism]]'s sense of the
word). The principal thesis of Situationism was that art prefigures or
anticipates what is possible in the social. This idea, which owes an
obvious debt to
[[Surrealism]], appealed to a
wide range of activist groups throughout the 1960s, especially the
so-called 'soixante-huitards' who participated in the events of [[May ’68]], and still today
influence protest movements of all types, but especially adbusters and
culturejammers.
Although they were orthodox Marxists, the Situationists did not favour
state-led communism or Stalinism (to give it its other name), and
therefore their relations with the Left were always quite fraught, which
was one of the main reasons why the group was so fractious and
expulsions so frequent. Their critique of everyday life hinged on the
concept of spectacle (*see* [society of the
spectacle](#X7168f8bc0850f3dc605cece61930d4076013af7)) developed by
Debord in *La Société du spectacle* (1967), translated as *Society of
the Spectacle* (1970). Debord's thesis is that capitalist society
compensates for the fragmentation of daily life with a numbing image of
false unity he calls the spectacle, which alienated workers of all types
unknowingly consume and accept as real life. Breaking people out of this
ideological slumber and enabling them to access authentic life is the
chief purpose behind Situationism's three key practices or methods:
[[dérive]],
[[détournement]], and
[[psychogeography]].
The other major theorist associated with Situationism was Belgian
scholar [[Vaneigem, Raoul]],
author of *Traité de savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes générations*
(1967), translated as *The Revolution of Everyday Life* (1983), a kind
of user's guide to the late twentieth century for the younger generation
(which is what the French title might be if it were more literally
rendered). Vaneigem's thesis, inspired by [[Reich, Wilhelm]] and [[Marcuse, Herbert]], is that
capitalism immiserates not by depriving people of their desires, but
fulfilling them, or at least appearing to. Thus abundance is the most
politically disabling state of all. The problem for Vaneigem is that
this type of society relies on passivity and
[[ressentiment]] or what
[[Sloterdijk, Peter]] calls
[[cynical reason]] rather
than conscious affirmation.
The spectacle or inauthentic
[[hyperreality]] of late
twentieth-century existence the Situationists deplored and hoped could
be transfigured by means of *dérive* and *détournement* is precisely the
[[simulacrum]] universe [[Baudrillard, Jean]] argues we are
condemned to. And though Baudrillard would chide Debord and others for
their seeming nostalgia for authenticity, his own work, especially the
later pieces, exhibits much the same longing. More importantly, the
Situationists were
[[utopia]], always looking
to the future, and their practices were intended to hasten its arrival
not transport them back in time to some mythical past.
