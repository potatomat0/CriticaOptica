[[sexism]]

 The assumption that
a person is inferior because of their sex, regardless of any other
attribute, effectively reducing them to the status of an
[[object]]. [[feminist theory]] uses the term sexism
to classify political and cultural
[[practices]] or works that
denigrate women, or exclude them (most often by omission).
