[[social movement]]

 A
contemporary term for a politicized group of people united by a common
purpose. The term was introduced by German sociologist Lorenz von Stein
in 1850 in a book on the political history of post-revolutionary France.
He adopted the notion from
[[Marxism]] and
[[langue]]'s *Communist Manifesto* published two years previously. Charles Tilly, in his
authoritative history, *Social Movements 1768--2004* (2004), argues that
social movements emerged as a synthesis of three different elements: (i)
public campaigns directed at specific government bodies with a view to
either preventing them from taking an action (such as building a road
through a nature reserve) or compelling them into taking an action (such
as increasing funding for healthcare); (ii) special purpose coalitions
(e.g. vigils, rallies, marches, petition drives, media stunts, and so
on); (iii) public representations of WUNC---worthiness, unity, numbers,
and commitment (e.g. signing petitions, attending marches, showing
solidarity by wearing badges and so forth). Social movements employ all
these [[tactics]], but they
do so in a more sustained and intense manner. The term entered the
popular vernacular in the late 1990s with the appearance of the
so-called anti-globalization movement, which rose in response to the
formation of the World Trade Organization. *See also*
