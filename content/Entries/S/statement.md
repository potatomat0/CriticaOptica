[[statement]]
 (*énoncé*)

 French
historian [[Foucault, Michel]]'s term for the
most elementary unit of
[[discourse]]. It does not
correlate to a sentence, word, or even a proposition. It does not have
the same kind of existence as either language or an object, though in
fact it can be constituted by both. Foucault's most famous example of a
statement is undoubtedly his claim that the keyboard of a typewriter is
not a statement, but when it is reproduced in a typing manual it is. It
is a statement about the construction of typewriter keyboards in a
particular country. This is a statement because it refers to a set of
laws of possibility or rules of existence---the shape and organization
of the keyboard, the need to master it, and so on.
