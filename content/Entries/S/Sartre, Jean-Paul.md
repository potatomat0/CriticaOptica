[[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]
(1905--80) French [[Marxism]]
philosopher best known as an exponent of
[[existentialism]]. He was
one of the most influential intellectuals of his generation. He was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964 in recognition of his
plays, novels, and philosophical works, but he declined it, saying that
a writer must not allow themselves to be transformed into an
institution.
Sartre was born in Thiviers in the Dordogne region of France, to
middle-class parents. His father was a naval officer, but died when
Sartre was only 15 months old. His mother moved back to Paris to live
with her parents, who effectively raised him. Sartre recalls his
childhood very fondly in his autobiography *Les Mots* (1963), translated
as *The Words* (1964), as a bookish paradise. His grandfather, Charles
Schweitzer, a relative of the Nobel prize-winning medical missionary
Albert Schweitzer, was a German teacher and author of works of cultural
criticism.
Sartre studied at the prestigious lycées Henri-IV and Louis-le-Grand,
before gaining entry to the École Normale Supérieure
([[ANT]]). His was an
illustrious class---his classmates included Raymond Aron, [[Beauvoir, Simone de]], [[Canguilhem, Georges]], Daniel
Lagache, and Paul Nizan. At the ENS he studied psychology and the
history of philosophy as well as sociology and physics. He failed on his
first attempt at *agrégation*---according to legend it was because he
tried to present his own ideas rather than those the examiners expected
him to recite---but passed on his second attempt, attaining the highest
score in France for that year (Beauvoir came second).
Legend also has it that Sartre became interested in
[[phenomenology]], which
served as the precursor to his own existentialist theories, when his
friend Raymond Aron returned from a year's study in Berlin and told him
that phenomenology meant that one could philosophize a glass of beer. He
was so inspired by this idea that on the way home from the pub he
stopped at a bookshop and purchased a book by
[[Dasein]] on
[[neurosis]]. In 1933,
following his compulsory military service, he made his own study trip to
Germany, which is where he first read
[[Heidegger, Martin]], and though he
could not have failed to see the rise of Nazism it made little
impression on him at the time. When he returned to France, he took a
teaching position at lycées in Le Havre, Laon, and Neuilly.
Sartre's first and probably best-known novel, *La Nausée* (Nausea)
appeared in 1938. It was well received critically, but was not an
immediate commercial success and Sartre privately worried that he was
going to be a failure. At the outbreak of World War II he was
immediately recalled into military service and was captured in 1940, but
fortunately for him was released when the armistice between France and
Germany was signed. As his posthumously published notebooks from this
period, *Les Carnets de la drôle de guerre: Novembre 1939--Mars 1940*
(1983), translated as *War Diaries: Notebooks from Phoney War November
1939--March 1940* (1984), make clear, his time in service and
particularly in prison focused his mind on the question of freedom,
which would become the central problematic of his thinking for the rest
of his life.
War seemed to galvanize Sartre as a writer. The period between 1940 and
1945 was a highly productive one. He started to write for the theatre,
using his plays as opportunities to criticize the German occupiers, but
also to explore his concept of existentialism. Probably his most famous
line, 'hell is other people', was coined in this period, occurring in
the play *Huis Clos* (1944), translated as *No Exit* (1990). He also
wrote a trilogy of novels about the war published under the collective
title *Chemins de la liberté* (1945), translated as *The Roads to
Freedom* (1990). But if Sartre emerged from the war as one of the most
prominent intellectuals in France (and in the years to follow he became
one of the most prominent intellectuals in the world) it was because of
*L'Être et le néant* (1943), translated as *Being and Nothingness*
(1958), which in its evocation of freedom as a kind of intolerable
burden resonated perfectly with the tenor of the times. It became a
bestseller, thus giving Sartre financial independence, allowing him the
freedom to become a writer without the necessity of also having to hold
down a university post.
*Being and Nothingness* introduced the world to the notion of *mauvaise foi* or [[bad faith]], which
Sartre opposes to the
[[psychoanalysis]] notion of
consciousness. As the title suggests, the book constructs a
[[dialectic]] opposition
between Being (the objects of consciousness) and Nothingness (the
consciousness itself, which has no Being). In apprehending objects,
though, consciousness has being-for-itself, while objects only have
being-in-themselves. This distinction is important to Sartre because he
wants to argue that it is *how* we think about the world that is
crucial, not the sheer fact of the world itself. This becomes
problematical when we factor in what it means to be looked at by another
person (to fall under their
[[gaze]], in other
words)---in that situation we are simultaneously a consciousness of
something and an object of a consciousness. Our being-for-itself is in a
sense degraded by this state of affairs and turned into what Sartre
rather bleakly calls being-for-others. Sartre developed this problematic
further in the long delayed follow-up work, *Critique de la Raison
Dialectique* (1960), translated as *Critique of Dialectical Reason*
(1976).
In 1947, beginning as a series of articles in the journal he co-founded
with Beauvoir and
[[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]], *Les Temps
moderne*, then re-published as the book *Qu'est-ce que la littérature?*
Sartre introduced the notion of *littérature engagée* or committed
writing, which was to define what writing meant for at least the next
decade or so. Its influence can perhaps be seen most clearly in [[Barthes, Roland]]'s attempt to move
beyond its somewhat dogmatic structures in *Le Degré zéro de l'écriture*
(1953), translated as *Writing Degree Zero* (1967). Sartre rejected an
aesthetics of 'pure writing' for its own sake and argued that the writer
had a responsibility to explore and interrogate universal values of
freedom. Ironically, none of the writers Sartre would subsequently write
about at such length, particularly not Flaubert, to whom he devoted over
3,000 pages of close analysis in *L'Idiot de la famille* (1971--72),
translated as *The Family Idiot* (1993), but not Genet or Mallarmé
either, engaged in this particular task.
If the 1950s belonged to Sartre (as [[Jameson, Fredric]] once put it), then
the 1960s belonged to
[[structuralism]], and the
influence of his work fell into decline, though he personally was still
much in demand as a political activist and voice. He championed Third
World writers such as [[Fanon, Frantz]], for whose *Les Damnés de la terre* (1961), translated as *The Wretched of the Earth*
(1965) he provided a famous preface in which he provocatively declared
that the earth numbers 'two thousand million inhabitants: five hundred
million men, and one thousand five hundred million natives. The former
had the Word; the others had the use of it.' Sartre's legacy is perhaps
less a specific body of work, which today has few followers, and more an
attitude, that of the 'engaged' or 'committed' intellectual and writer.
This is how the generation that followed him, [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Foucault, Michel]], among others,
thought of him. He was a 'breath of fresh air', Deleuze said.
