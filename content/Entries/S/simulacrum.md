[[simulacrum]]

 Although the
term has been used in philosophy since ancient times, it was really only
in the twentieth century that it acquired the significance it has today.
The two most important names that have come to be associated with this
concept are [[Baudrillard, Jean]] and [[Deleuze, Gilles]].
Baudrillard tends to use the words
[[simulation]] and simulacrum
interchangeably, and offers not so much a new theory of the simulacrum
as a new history of the present viewed through the conceptual lens of
the simulacrum. For Baudrillard, the simulacrum is essentially the copy
of a copy, that is to say, the copy of something that is not itself an
original, and is hence an utterly degraded form. At its limit, as in
certain accounts of
[[postmodernism]], the
simulacrum is used to deny the possibility of anything being the
singular source or origin of either an idea or a thing. On this view of
things, anything deemed to be an original idea or object is in fact a
mirage, an optical illusion of the same order as back-projection in
cinema. Another way of putting this would be to say that a simulacrum is
only ever an effect and never a cause.
In contrast, Deleuze uses the concept of the simulacrum against that of
the simulation, to create an
[[immanence]] theory of
[[representation]]. The
simulacrum is not a concept Deleuze wrote much about, indeed he only
addresses it directly in two essays (on Plato and Lucretius) attached as
appendices to *Logique du Sens* (1969), translated as *Logic of Sense*
(1990), but his contribution has been decisive. His argument is that the
copy or simulation is an image *with* resemblance (by definition, the
copy resembles the thing copied), whereas the simulacrum is an image
*without* resemblance (man is made in the image of God, according to
catechism, but since the fall---i.e. because of his sin---he no longer
resembles Him). The simulacrum is not just a degraded copy, Deleuze
argues, it has its own positive power, which interrupts the relation
between original and copy. His example of this is Pop Art, which in his
view pushed the copy so far it became a simulacrum, an image without
resemblance (e.g. Andy Warhol's famous Campbell's Soup prints).
