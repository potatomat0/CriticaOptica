[[singularity]]

 The critical
threshold or division between two states of being, e.g. between boiling
and not boiling. At such a point it is impossible to decide whether the
object is in one state of being or another---thus, one would have to say
it is neither boiling nor not-boiling and in this precise sense it is
properly referred to as undecidable. Both [[Badiou, Alain]] and [[Deleuze, Gilles]] define the event
in terms of singularity, substituting it for
[[essence]], which they both
dismiss as overly Platonic.
