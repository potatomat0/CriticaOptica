[[synchronic]]

 and diachronic A
binary pair introduced by [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] to define the two
available temporal axes for the analysis of language, which can
logically be extended to encompass virtually all forms of human
activity. Linguistics, in Saussure's time, approached the problem of the
multiplicity of languages by trying to trace each of them back to a
handful of common sources (in much the same way as evolutionary
biologists approach the problem of the multiplicity of species). This
approach was deemed diachronic by Saussure because it looks for the
production of difference across time. But for Saussure this ignored the
(to him, more interesting and important) problem of how to account for
the existence and operation of language itself. To get a handle on this,
he insisted that it was necessary to take a snapshot of language at a
particular time and effectively produce a freeze-frame of it. This
approach he referred to as synchronic. By freezing time, or better
ignoring its effects, Saussure thought it would be easier to see that
which was eternal and universal.
