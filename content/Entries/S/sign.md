[[sign]]

 The basic unit of
interest for [[semiotics]].
It is perhaps best apprehended as a unit of meaning whose principal
point of distinction is the fact that it is not meaningful in itself,
but is only ever a sign of (or pointer to) a theoretically 'full'
meaning that lies elsewhere. Although the two principal 'fathers' of
semiotics, [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] and [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]], did not
agree on whether the sign is a binary or tertiary construct, their
independently arrived at conceptions of the sign nonetheless share a
number of key features. The sign is composed of two or three
inter-related and interactive parts which are distinct from one another
but inseparable. For Saussure, the sign consists of a signifier and a
signified---the former is the distinctive acoustic image (the 'c' sound
in 'cat', for instance, which sounds very different from the 't' sound
in the same word), while the latter is the mental concept we arbitrarily
associate with that sound (i.e. not an actual cat, but the idea of a
cat). For Peirce, the sign consists of the
[[representamen]], the
interpretant, and the
[[object]]---the
representamen is the perceptible object (or what is also known as the
sign vehicle), the interpretant is the meaning or the effect of the
sign, while the object is that which the sign represents. In both cases,
too, the sign is greater than its constituent material vehicle (e.g. the
colour red in a traffic light is only one part of the semiotic signal
drivers use to know when to stop); it is not identical with its material
vehicle (i.e. the colour red is not in and of itself a sign); nor is it
identical with its elements (i.e. the colour red is only one part of the
sign).
