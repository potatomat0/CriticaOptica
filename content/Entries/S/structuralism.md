[[structuralism]]

 One of the
most important and wide-reaching intellectual movements of the twentieth
century. It is often referred to as a 'linguistic turn' because the
origin of the method is the insight, derived from the work of Swiss
linguist [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]], that virtually
all human creations can be understood as though they were structured
like language. Indeed, French psychoanalyst [[Lacan, Jacques]] went so far as to
pronounce that the
[[unconscious]] is structured
like a language. The crucial implication of Lacan's claim, often missed,
is that what this means is that the unconscious is a system, just as
language is a system, and that they are both structured in the same way.
For the same reason, it is also described as an anti-humanist method
because it neither prioritizes nor privileges the human subject or
individual conscious.
Interestingly, in *Cours de linguistique générale* (1916), translated as
*Course in General Linguistics* (1959), to which the origins of
structuralism are generally traced, Saussure never used the word
'structure', his preference was for the term 'system', which was in fact
the more apt choice. What Saussure set out to discover was the universal
system of language itself, that which is common to all languages. He
wanted to know *how* language means, not *what* its meanings are. To do
this, he had to change the way linguistics looked at language. Saussure
made three crucial moves, which taken together add up to the basic
methodological matrix of structuralism.
First, he shifted attention from the temporal to the spatial dimension
of language. Until then, linguistics (still a branch of philology and
not yet the science it has since become) focused on the history or
evolution of specific languages, charting changes in pronunciation,
spelling, vocabulary, grammar, and so on across time. Saussure referred
to this trajectory of analysis as the
[[diachronic]] axis and while
he conceded its importance he argued that it left unanswered the
question of what language is. He focused instead on what he called the
[[synchronic]] axis, which is
language as it is right now, and his way in was to think about the
intriguing problem of why different languages have different words for
the same thing, or similar words with different meanings.
The second move, namely his conclusion to the foregoing problem, which
after several decades of delay revolutionized the human sciences, was
that the relation between a particular sound and its meaning is
*arbitrary*. Saussure had thus to make a further distinction between the
concrete fact of a language as it is spoken in the present (which he
referred to as [[parole]])
and the underlying system of combination enabling language to function
as a mode of communication (which he referred to as
[[langue]]). *Langue* and
*parole* are inseparable, but while *parole* must, of necessity, have a
concrete presence, *langue* does not. *Parole* is an imperfect and
partial realization or instantiation of *langue* and Saussure's genius
was to use it to triangulate what the 'whole' system must look like.
*Langue* as Saussure understood it is a social fact, that is to say a
greater conceptual entity than a single individual can grasp, regardless
of how many languages they may have mastered.
Finally, Saussure proposed that linguistics should change the object of
its analysis from words to what he called
[[sign]]. Signs, which are
the concrete instantiations of *parole*, whose meaningfulness is made
possible by *langue*, are composed of two elements, a signifier
(*signifiant*) and a signified (*signifié*). The former is the sound of
a particular word, which must be both distinguishable from other sounds
and reproducible (it is these twin attributes that separate phonetics
from sheer noise). The latter is the concept we generally associate with
that sound. The relationship is not that of a word and a thing
([[referent]]), which would
reduce language to a naming system. The sign is not self-sufficient, as
a symbol is, but relies on a system of inter-relating differences for
its meaning.
Structuralism became a global intellectual movement when its methodology
was adopted by other disciplines and adapted to suit their own specific
objectives and problematics. The first discipline to do so was
anthropology, led by [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]], who was
introduced to Saussure's work by [[Jakobson, Roman]] in New York,
where they were both exiled during World War II (the two co-published a
number of short explorations of what a structuralist method might look
like outside of linguistics). In philosophy, it was [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]] who took the
initiative, while in literary studies it was [[Barthes, Roland]] who paved the way
forward, and film studies ([[Metz, Christian]]), psychoanalysis
([[Lacan, Jacques]]), and
Marxism ([[Althusser, Louis]])
followed suit.
The advantage of structuralism over other methods was, as later critics
came to realize, also its inherent disadvantage. Nevertheless, its
advantages are considerable, as can be seen in popular fiction studies,
where its power of comparative analysis continues to be useful. [[Eco, Umberto]]'s analysis of James
Bond novels and films in *The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the
Semiotics of Texts* (1979) is exemplary in this respect. Eco reads the
entire Bond catalogue and extracts a series of features in common to
them all at the level of the organization of the narrative. In this way,
he is able to show how the Bond 'machine' functions to create stories
that are consistent, similar in their essentials, yet different enough
to satisfy readers, and thus open a window into the
[[unconscious]] of author and
reader. A similar approach has been used by Janice Radway in her
analysis of popular romances, *Reading the Romance* (1991) and Will
Wright in his study of westerns, *Sixguns and Society* (1992). The most
sophisticated analysis of this type is undoubtedly [[James, C. L. R.]]'s [[semiotic square]].
The disadvantages of structuralism are twofold: first, as Marxist
critics like [[Jameson, Fredric]] have pointed out,
structuralism is ahistorical (deliberately so, since it was the refusal
of the diachronic that enabled the focus on the synchronic), which is a
problem because although it is able to identify the various models and
machines operative in culture, it cannot explain how they were created,
nor why they persist; second, as [[Derrida, Jacques]] has pointed out,
the signified does not supply the signifier with a meaning because it
itself is undecided. Almost any example will prove this point---if the
concept of redness is the signified of the signifier 'red', then what
gives 'redness' its meaning? Derrida thus argues the whole system is
based on an illusion of 'presence', that is the presence of a definitive
meaning. Derrida is generally credited with bringing the structuralist
era to a close at a conference in Baltimore which, ironically enough,
was intended to showcase structuralism to American scholars.
