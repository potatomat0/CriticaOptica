[[Soja, Edward]] 
(1940--2015)


American [[Marxism]]
geographer. Soja obtained a PhD from Syracuse University for a thesis on
urban planning in Kenya. His early work focused on Africa. However, it
is for his later work on Los Angeles that he is most widely known,
starting with *Postmodern Geographies: The Reassertion of Space in
Critical Social Theory* (1989), which along with the work of [[Harvey, David]] introduced
[[postmodernism]] as a new
kind of [[problematic]] that
geographers should take note of. Utilizing the work of [[Lefebvre, Henri]], Soja expanded on
*Postmodern Geographies* with two further works also devoted to Los
Angeles, *Thirdspace: Journeys to Real-and-Imagined-Places* (1996) and
*Postmetropolis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions* (2000). Soja's
work was distinctive for the way he factored the imagination into his
geography: he argued persuasively that a city like Los Angeles, which is
so consciously invested in image-production of all types, cannot be
adequately engaged with if the imagination is not taken into account.
