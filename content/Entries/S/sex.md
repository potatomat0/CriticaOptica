[[sex]]

 Michel Foucault's
three-volume work *The History of Sexuality*, the first instalment of
which was published in 1976, asked the question how and under what
circumstances did 'sex' become a subject of
[[discourse]]. Foucault
pursued this question along a number of different lines of inquiry. To
begin with, he was intrigued by the fact that the Victorian era is
generally regarded as one of the most sexually repressive eras in
history (e.g. legend has it that even the legs of pianos had to be
covered lest they elicit too much excitement from onlookers), but also
witnessed an explosion of interest in sex and an enormous proliferation
of discourse about sex. Thus, according to Foucault, the real question
one must ask about the Victorian era is not why was sex so repressed,
but why we say with such passion that sex was repressed. How and why did
sex come to be something that could only be spoken of as though it was
hidden and repressed? Why do we think previous historical periods were
more open about sex than our own? In the following volumes, Foucault
turned his attention to the ancient Greeks and early Christians. In so
doing he demonstrated not only that sex has been differently constructed
and thought about both throughout the ages and by different religions
and different ethnic groups, but also that sex itself cannot be taken
for granted. Foucault's work decisively moved sex out of the realm of
the biological and firmly into the realm of the cultural. Sex, he
argued, did not pre-exist our concern for it---sex was invented by
people who wanted to wield
[[power]] not only over it,
but through it. The stigmatization of homosexuality is, for example, a
way of constructing a weapon against a particular group of people, not
simply a reaction to a specific form of
[[sexuality]]. Foucault's
work also demonstrated the widely varying ways sex is laid claim to by
different discourses: in medical discourse it is a matter of health, in
legal discourse it is a matter for regulation, while in religious
discourse it is a matter for moral debate and consideration. In the
course of writing these books, Foucault began to develop his notions of
[[biopower]] and
[[governmentality]].
