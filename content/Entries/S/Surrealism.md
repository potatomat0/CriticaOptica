[[Surrealism]]

 Artistic
movement dating from the last days of World War I and ending in 1966
(some like Maurice Nadeau, the movement's semi-official historian, would
say it is alive still) with the death of [[Breton, André]], the unofficial
Pope of Surrealism. Its peak period was the two decades between the two
World Wars, the tumultuous years which saw the stock market crash in
1929 and fascism take power in Italy, Spain, and Germany. It was also a
period of hope for the international Left, with whom Surrealism
sympathized.
Although it began as a literary movement, it is doubtless better known
for its striking visuals---none more so than the excruciatingly vivid,
eye-slicing scene in Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel's 1929 film *Un Chien
andalou* (An Andalusian Dog) which was Dalí's debut on the Parisian
scene. The movement's playful aesthetic is captured in Comte de
Lautréamont's definition of beauty in *Chants de Maldoror* (1868), which
became a kind of Surrealist slogan or watchword: 'the chance meeting of
a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table'.
The word 'Surrealism' was coined by Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917, but
it was Breton who gave the term the meaning we recognize today in the
first *Surrealist Manifesto* (1924). Surrealism, he said, is pure
psychic automatism, which through writing or any other artistic means,
expresses the true functioning of thought, by which he meant thought
unconstrained by reason, or by moral, ethical, or aesthetic
considerations. Influenced by [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s *Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens* (1901), translated as *The Psychopathology of Everyday Life* (1914), Surrealism wanted to get in
touch with the untutored creativity of the unconscious itself and
dissolve the dividing line between art and life. Interestingly, Freud
himself was unimpressed by Surrealism, and did not warm to Breton when
the two met in Vienna in 1921.
Surrealism adapted Freud's therapeutic technique of [[free association]] to develop its
two signature artistic procedures: automatic writing (a [[stream of consciousness]] flow of words,
thoughts, and ideas written down without regard for syntax or sense) and
collage (random combinations of images and materials). German cultural
critic, [[Benjamin, Walter]],
writing in 1929, described the often quite provocative results of these
techniques as inspiring a 'profane illumination'. Virtually every medium
of art experimented with Surrealist techniques during the movement's
heyday, leading to the production of several memorable works, with the
exception of music which never found a way of accommodating itself to
its emphasis on chance and randomness.
In literature, Surrealism yielded Louis Aragon's *Paris Peasant* (1924)
and André Breton's *Nadja* (1928); in cinema it was the aforementioned
Buñuel who led the way, but even Alfred Hitchcock experimented with
Surrealism (he hired Dalí to design a dream sequence for his 1945Ingrid
Bergman and Gregory Peck feature, *Spellbound*); in photography it was
Man Ray, Lee Miller (Man Ray's model and muse), Eugène Atget, and Max
Ernst who set the standard; in the visual arts it was undoubtedly Dalí
who captured the limelight, but no less important were René Magritte,
André Masson, Joan Miró, and Yves Tanguy; in the plastic arts, it was
Marcel Duchamp who created the best-known works; while in theatre it was
undoubtedly [[Artaud, Antonin]] who was the most
notorious, though he later denounced Surrealism (itself a very
Surrealist thing to do, judging by the frequency of the denunciations
and expulsions the group experienced).
Surrealism was a direct influence on three major figures in critical
theory: [[Bataille, Georges]],
[[Lefebvre, Henri]], and
[[Lacan, Jacques]]; and a
distant, but not insignificant influence on [[Baudrillard, Jean]] and [[Debord, Guy]].
