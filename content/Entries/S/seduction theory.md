[[seduction theory]]

 In the
development phase of
[[psychoanalysis]], [[Freud, Sigmund]] initially thought
that all [[neurosis]] were
the product of sexual abuse in childhood. He soon realized that not
everything his patients reported referred to actual events.
Psychoanalysis effectively begins from the moment Freud abandons this
theory and starts to think more closely about the role of
[[fantasy]] and the
[[imaginary]] in shaping the
[[unconscious]]. In 1984, the
director of the Freud archives, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, published
*The Assault on Truth*, which controversially charged that Freud
abandoned his seduction theory in order to cover up the fact that so
many of his patients had been abused. According to Masson, Freud was
worried that it would discredit his theory and harm his professional
standing. Debate on this topic continues, but without any clear
conclusion. Janet Malcom's *In the Freud Archives* (1984) provides an
account of how Masson was transformed from archivist to
anti-psychoanalysis activist, but rather disappointingly does not clear
Freud of this charge, or show that the charge is without foundation.
