[[supermodernity]]
**(*surmodernité*)** French anthropologist [[Augé, Marc]]'s term for the
present historical conjuncture as outlined in a series of four books
commencing with: *Non-Lieux, Introduction à une anthropologie de la
surmodernité* (1992), translated as *Non-Places: Introduction to an
Anthropology of Supermodernity* (1995); *Le Sens des autres: Actualité
de l'anthropologie* (1994), translated as *A Sense for the Other: The
Timeliness and Relevance of Anthropology* (1998); *Pour une
anthropologie des mondes contemporains* (1994), translated as *An Anthropology for Contemporaneous Worlds* (1998); and *Le Guerre des
rêves: exercises d'ethno-fiction* (1997), translated as *The War of
Dreams: Exercises in Ethno-Fiction* (1999). The present times, as Augé
sees things, are not so much 'post' modern, in the sense of spelling the
end of something, as being in excess of the modern, meaning the present
age is not yet different in kind from what we refer to as 'modernity',
but in the extremeness of its difference in degree it is rapidly
approaching that point. Another way of putting this is to note that
three symptoms of modernity have, for their own different historical
reasons, come to define the present in a way that was not previously
true. The three excesses he speaks of are: (i) time; (ii) space; (iii)
individuality.
By an excess of time, Augé means our sense of contemporaneity is
stretched past its limit by the welter of events we are expected to
register at any one time. The exemplary image of this is, as Jameson has
suggested, the gaunt figure of David Bowie in *The Man Who Fell to
Earth* (director, Roeg 1976), helplessly watching some 50 televisions at
once. The excess of space, which goes hand in hand with the excess of
time, and obviously exacerbates it, too, is the paradoxical result of
the so-called shrinking of the planet---air travel puts even the
remotest regions of the globe within reach, satellite technology allows
us to view the world from our living rooms and watch events unfold in
real time. The excess of individuality is the paradoxical result of the
enforced solitudes of modern life---long commutes to work, the lonely
hours in front of the computer, and so on. Our ego expands to fill the
vacuum of the shattered collectivities that in more traditional times
coordinated daily life. There is an obvious element of nostalgia in
Augé's analyses, but there is also a serious and interesting attempt to
fabricate a new way of thinking about and doing anthropology. *See also*
