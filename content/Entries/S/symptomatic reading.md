[[symptomatic reading]]

 A mode
of reading literary and historical works proposed by French Marxist
[[Althusser, Louis]] which
focuses on the text's underlying presuppositions. In particular it tries
to determine what a particular text is unable to say or represses
because of its
[[glocalization]] conviction.
For example, one might compare the frontier literature of Australia and
America, both of which countries are the product of colonial conquest,
and inquire why their respective literary traditions are so different:
America produced the western, whereas Australia created stories of lost
children and isolated battlers.
