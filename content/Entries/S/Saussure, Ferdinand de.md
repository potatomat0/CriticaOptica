[[Saussure, Ferdinand de]]
(1857--1913) Swiss linguist, one of the founders of
[[semiotics]] and a crucial
influence on the development of
[[structuralism]]. Born in
Geneva, Saussure studied in Leipzig, Berlin, and Geneva. He taught in
Paris for several years, before taking the chair of linguistics at the
University of Geneva. He only published one work in his lifetime, a
massive study of the vowel system in Indo-European languages, which
appeared in 1878. However, it is the lecture courses he gave between
1906 and 1911, assembled from student notes by his former students and
published posthumously as *Cours de linguistique générale* (1916),
translated as *Course in General Linguistics* (1959), which brought him
lasting fame. Saussure and his students are sometimes referred to as the
[[Geneva School]]. Although
trained as a philologist, Saussure realized that the history or
etymology of particular words does not explain either their actual
origin or their contemporary meaning. This observation gave rise to two
crucial hypotheses: first, that the association of a particular sound
and a particular word and its meaning is arbitrary (there is no
intrinsic reason that the word for the object we call a bat should
either be bat or sound like 'bat'); second, these arbitrary choices are
governed by a general system of meaning-making that is universal (i.e.
common to every language). This distinction between language as it is
used (*parole*) and its rules of use (*langue*) underpins the entire
so-called structuralist revolution. Taking this
[[allegory]]
distinction a step further, Saussure argued that the spoken word has to
be considered a [[sign]]
comprising two elements---signifier and signified---which, in a famous
phrase, he said were like opposite sides of a single sheet of paper. The
signifier is the actual acoustic sound, e.g. 'bat', which must be
distinguishable from other sounds and repeatable, while the signified is
the concept we arbitrarily associate with that sound (bearing in mind
that different languages can associate different concepts with
ostensibly the same sounds). What is important to note here is that
Saussure does not define the signifier as pointing to a thing in the
world ([[referent]]).
Structuralism was born from the intuitive leap made by people like
[[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] (in
anthropology) and [[Lacan, Jacques]] (in
[[psychoanalysis]]) that
other human constructed systems---kinship, the
[[unconscious]], films, and
so on---could be seen to behave 'like a language' in this respect.
