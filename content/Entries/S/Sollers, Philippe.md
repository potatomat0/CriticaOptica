[[Sollers, Philippe]]
 (1936--)


French writer and editor. Born in Bordeaux to a middle-class family of
factory owners, he was educated at the Jesuits' École Sainte-Geneviève,
but was expelled. He pretended to have schizophrenia to escape
compulsory military service in Algeria. He adopted the nom de plume
Sollers (his real name is Joyaux) in the early 1950s. His first novel
*Une Curieuse Solitude* (A Strange Solitude), which he would later
disavow, was published in 1958. It received high praise from Louis
Aragon and François Mauriac, prompting Sollers to quip that his career
had been launched with the help of both the Kremlin and the Vatican.
Sollers experimented with the style of the so-called [[nouveau roman]] (new novel) pioneered
by Alain Robbe-Grillet and Claude Simon, but later dismissed it as
overly academic. A devotee of the work of James Joyce---he collaborated
with Stephen Heath to translate *Finnegans Wake* (1939) into French and
famously pronounced that novel to be the most formidably anti-fascist
work produced between the two World Wars---Sollers's work displays a
similar interest in language's prodigious capacity for meaning. He
created the journal *Tel Quel* in 1960 and it rapidly overtook *Les Temps moderne* as the leading intellectual publication of its time. For
a period of over 20 years, *Tel Quel* set the international benchmark
for new and innovative thinking and writing by publishing figures such
as [[Barthes, Roland]],
[[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Foucault, Michel]], and [[Kristeva, Julia]]. Many of them,
Barthes and Derrida in particular, repaid the compliment by writing fine
studies of Sollers's own work. Through the 1960s Sollers was an avid
Maoist and together with Barthes and Kristeva made study trips to China
to witness the Cultural Revolution at first hand. The journal folded in
the early 1980s, at least in part because of disagreements within its
editorial board about how to respond to Maoism. In 1983 Sollers launched
a new journal, *L'Infini*, which much as its predecessor did, continues
to publish cutting-edge work in [[critical theory]] and creative writing.
