[[symbolic exchange]] 

[[Baudrillard, Jean]] 's theory for a
model of exchange which existed prior to capitalism in which goods and
actions that have no intrinsic
[[value]] are exchanged for
purely symbolic reasons. It is like a
[[performative]], in this
respect, because it is the fact of the exchange being made that is
socially significant in symbolic exchange, not the nature of substance
of what is exchanged. In so-called 'primitive' societies, exchanges had
to be made in a way that did not obligate the receiver to reciprocate
and thus incur a debt. The perfect gift was therefore a 'useless' or
purely symbolic gift. When the gift is symbolic in itself, or useful,
then symbolic exchange is extinguished and the twin motors of
capitalism---exchange-value and use-value---take its place.
