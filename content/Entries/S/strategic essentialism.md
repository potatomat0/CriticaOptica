[[strategic essentialism]]

 The
political practice of overlooking the fact that from a
[[post-structuralism]]
perspective [[essence]] (in
a philosophical sense) are difficult to sustain both
[[collocation]] and
[[epistemology]]. For
example, few [[feminist theory]] would agree that
there is a set of definable attributes essential to the idea, the
concept, or the actuality of woman. Yet the more one pushes this
[[deconstruction]] line of
thinking, the harder it becomes to establish common ground, or more
especially common cause, sufficient to the needs of political action. If
all women are irreducibly different, then why should they act together?
The same problem besets all political groups defined by their
[[identity]] (e.g.
[[race]],
[[class]], ethnicity, sexual
orientation). For that reason, US-based Indian critic [[Spivak, Gayatri]] proposes the notion
of a strategic essentialism which simultaneously recognizes the
impossibility of any essentialism and the necessity of some kind of
essentialism for the sake of political action. French
[[feminism]] critic [[Irigaray, Luce]] has taken up this
term in her work for precisely the same reason.
