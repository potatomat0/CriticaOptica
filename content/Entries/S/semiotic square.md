[[semiotic square]]

 A graphic
figure used by the Paris-based Lithuanian linguist [[Greimas, Algirdas Julien]] to map out the
deep structure of meaning, and more especially meaning-production.
Premised on the principle of difference established by Swiss linguist
[[Saussure, Ferdinand de]]
that something means what it does by power of its ability to
simultaneously differentiate itself from and negate what it doesn't
mean, the semiotic square is built from a combination of simple
opposition and complex negation. The four corners of the 'square'
designated S1, S2, S1′ and S2′ respectively, represent different
positions in the production of meaning. The resulting graphic (*see*
illustration) should be read from left to right as well as vertically
and transversally.

As [[Jameson, Fredric]] puts
it in his foreword to the translation of Greimas's *On Meaning* (1987),
a compilation of his writings on the theme of meaning, it takes a lot of
'working out' to establish exactly how these terms should be
distributed. For example, take the term 'freedom' if we place that in
the S1 position then we can say that its simple opposite S2 is
'unfreedom', whereas its negation S2′ might be something like
'enslaved', suggesting that the final term S1′, normally reserved for
the negation of the negation should be 'liberation'. By juxtaposing
freedom and liberation the semiotic square compels us to think through
the 'gap' or 'distance' between these two terms, thus asking what is at
stake in choosing one over the other. It is for this reason that Jameson
suggests that the semiotic square (as is amply evidenced by his own use
of the device) can be utilized to develop a
[[dialectic]] reading of
texts.
