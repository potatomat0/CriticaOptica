[[Simondon, Gilbert]]
(1924--89) French philosopher of technology and society. His work is
championed by his friend [[Deleuze, Gilles]], and it has been
influential in the formation of [[new materialism]], but due to a
lack of translations his work is relatively little known in Anglophone
circles. However, the appearance of new translations of his major works
is likely to change that situation. As a student, he studied philosophy,
psychology, and physics, a fact reflected in his later work, especially
his most important book *Du Mode d'existence des objets techniques*
(1958), translated as *On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects*
(2017). Simondon's work was primarily concerned with
[[ontology]], specifically
the problem of individuation, not just how individuals emerge out of a
particular milieu but also why they exist. In *L'Individuation à la
lumière des notions de forme et d'information* (1964), Simondon argued
that one cannot explain the individual by the milieu nor the milieu by
the individual, and that one cannot reduce the one to the other.
Individuation presupposes a metastable state of being, a field of
pre-individual
[[existentialism]] rich in
potential, out of which the individual emerges in much the same way that
crystals emerge from media.
