[[syncretism]]

 Used in cultural
anthropology and [[Cultural Studies]] to describe the
synthetic cultural productions that result from the coming together of
[[diaspora]] cultures (e.g.
bhangra and reggae). Syncretism differs from
[[hybridity]] in that its
synthesis can occur across class as well as race barriers.
