[[Searle, John Rogers]]
(1932--) American analytic philosopher, best known for his work on
[[speech act]] theory, but
also well known for his work on the philosophy of mind. Born in
Colorado, Searle completed his undergraduate degree in philosophy at the
University of Wisconsin. He then went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar to
complete his DPhil. He worked briefly as a tutor at Oxford before
returning to the US to take a position at the University of California,
Berkeley, where he has been ever since. Searle's reputation is based on
his extension of [[Austin, John Langshaw]]'s idea in *How to
Do Things with Words* (1962) that sentences can perform actions as well
as state facts and express truths. In *Speech Acts: An Essay in the
Philosophy of Language* (1969), Searle develops the idea of an indirect,
or illocutionary speech act, listing five different varieties:
assertives (true or false), directives (obliging an action), commissives
(promise of action), expressives (revealing of speaker's psychological
state), and declaratives (which cause something to happen). This work
has proved useful in the development of artificial intelligence. Searle
became widely known outside the closed ranks of American analytic
philosophy when he got involved in a very public debate with French
philosopher [[Derrida, Jacques]], over a short
critique the latter wrote of Austin's theory in *Marges de la
philosophie* (1972), translated as *Margins of Philosophy* (1982). In an
essay entitled, 'Reiterating the Differences' Searle wrote a sharp
critique of Derrida and defence of Austin, which prompted a book-length
rebuke from Derrida: *Limited Inc.* (1988).
