[[Queer Studies]]

 The study of
sexual identity and its related cultural history. It emerged as the
academic response to the Stonewall Riots in 1969, initially as a
challenge to the academy, but very rapidly became a standard inclusion
(albeit in a very tokenistic way) in most humanities and social sciences
faculties. It would be an exaggeration to claim that Queer Studies has
become mainstream, but its exceptional status is certainly a thing of
the past. As a field it has become substantial enough to generate
several subfields including Asian Queer Studies, Black Queer Studies,
Queer Cinema, Queer Nation, and [[Queer Theory]]. Although the obvious
point of focus for Queer Studies is
[[gay]] and lesbian people,
the deeper purpose of Queer Studies is to challenge the efficacy of such
labels to begin with. It questions why
[[society]] should allocate
resources and grant privileges according to sexual orientation. In this
respect, its approach, which tends to be highly interdisciplinary,
mirrors that of [[Postcolonial Studies]],
[[feminism]], and
[[race]] studies.
