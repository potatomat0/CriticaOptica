[[quilting point]]

 **(*point de
capiton*)** A term introduced by [[Lacan, Jacques]] to define the points
along a signifying chain where the signifier is attached to the
signified, at least momentarily. The term is taken from upholstery and
refers to the attachment of buttons. A certain number of these quilting
points are necessary to the 'normal'
[[subject]]---their absence
is in fact a symptom of
[[psychosis]]. Without such
quilting points the subject would be incapable of navigating their
[[everyday life]] because
they would be constantly questioning the meaning of every
[[sign]] they encountered,
from the most mundane to the very elaborate.
