[[quasi-cause]] 

[[Deleuze, Gilles]] 's concept, derived
from Stoic philosophy, for the relation between two or more
(incorporeal) effects. In Stoic philosophy only bodies, that is material
things, can be causes in relation to one another; effects are not
causes, or even qualities, they are attributes, or events. Effects do
not exist, rather they inhere or subsist.
