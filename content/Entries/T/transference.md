[[transference]]
**(*Ãœbertragung*)** Initially used by [[Freud, Sigmund]] as an alternative
word to [[displacement]] for
describing the process of the transfer of libidinal energy between one
ideation of an
[[unconscious]] thought or
wish and another. However, he also used it to denote what occurs in the
relationship between analyst and analysand and it is this sense of the
term that has become dominant, not the least because of the influence of
[[Lacan, Jacques]], who
insists that the analytic relationship is the defining nucleus of
[[psychoanalysis]].
Transference of this latter type refers to the process whereby the
[[analysand]]
[[poetics]] onto the analyst
the affectionate (positive transference) or the hostile (negative
transference) feelings aroused by the analysis. In effect, the analysand
acts towards the analyst as though he or she were the embodiment of the
figure important to them from childhood (e.g. father, mother, uncle,
etc.). Freud noticed that this often occurred when the analysand seemed
most reluctant to reveal something, so he counted it among the defences
of the unconscious, describing it as a form of resistance. But inasmuch
as the analysand is thereby repeating or rehearsing the essentials of
the relationship they once had with their father, etc., the transference
could also be made to serve a positive therapeutic purpose because it
afforded the opportunity of working through in the immediacy of the
present the issues from the past.
