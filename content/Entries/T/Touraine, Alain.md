[[Touraine, Alain]]
 (1925--)


French post-Marxist sociologist with a strong interest in social
movements and the possibility of people-led politics. Born in the
wealthy seaside resort town of Hermanville-sur-Mer in Basse-Normandie
('Sword' beach in the D-Day landings in 1944) to a long line of medical
practitioners, Touraine broke the family mould, first by not studying
medicine, and second by not immediately pursuing further studies upon
graduation from École Normale Supérieure. Instead he took a job in a
coalmine. This experience awakened his desire to study and sharpened his
focus on sociology. He took a research position with Georges Friedman at
the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in 1950. But then in
1952, again breaking the expected pattern, he went to the US to
undertake graduate work with the giants of American sociology Talcott
Parsons and Paul Lazarsfeld. He returned to France in 1960 and completed
his doctorate at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, where
he has remained ever since. True to his coalmining inspiration to do
sociology in the first place, Touraine's early works were close
empirical studies of workers in factories and the fields. But in
contrast to his [[Marxism]]
colleagues, he did not view this in terms of revolutionary potential.
Indeed, in his unselfconsciously prophetic 1969 book translated as *The Post-Industrial Society. Tomorrow's Social History: Classes, Conflicts
and Culture in the Programmed Society* (1971), he would come to think of
the 1960s as the start of the so-called
[[post-industrial society]] period (a
term generally associated with [[Bell, Daniel]], though it was in
fact Touraine who coined the phrase) in which the central axis of the
economy, in the West at least, shifts from manufacturing to information,
leaving union labour behind. He wrote a rapid response to the events of
[[May ’68]], an experience
which seemed to spark his interest in social movements, giving rise to a
series of works, including case studies on the anti-nuclear movement in
France as well as the Solidarity movement in Poland. The overall
trajectory of his work, then, is towards a theory of the subject as a
rational actor capable of bringing about change in spite of the weight
of history.
