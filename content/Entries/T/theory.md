[[theory]]

 A generic term for
the interdisciplinary combination of philosophy, literary criticism, and
sociology produced by scholars like [[Barthes, Roland]], [[Foucault, Michel]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], and [[Deleuze, Gilles]]. It is difficult
to define theory in an exhaustive manner because it is by nature an
inclusive mode of discourse, though its detractors never seem to have
any such difficulties. It is perhaps best defined in terms of what it is
not: it is not philosophy because it rejects the possibility of one
philosophical system being capable of explaining everything; it is not
literary criticism because it is not interested in the meaning of
specific texts, but rather in the more general problem of how texts are
meaningful; it is not sociology either because it is mistrustful of
generalizations and does not accept that human behaviour can be
quantified. In many respects, however, the term is obsolete because its
real purpose was always to stake out the claim for a new way of
conceiving both the object and the subject of research in the
humanities, and now that purpose has been served, the term has lost its
edge. Even so, it is still possible to find people who say they 'don't
do theory', but they are getting rarer and rarer.
