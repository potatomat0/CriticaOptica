[[transcultural]]

 The movement
of ideas, influences, practices, and beliefs between cultures and the
fusions that result when the ideas, influences, practices, and beliefs
of different cultures come together in a specific place, text, or
[[contact zone]]. The
movement of cultures is not always reciprocal or voluntary---indeed, a
large majority of what is deemed transcultural is the product of
colonization, [[diaspora]] of
different types, and exile. Some examples are the product of the
necessary compromises subjugated cultures make in order to survive, as
was the uptake of Catholicism by indigenous peoples in South America. As
Michael Taussig demonstrates in *The Devil and Commodity Fetishism*
(1983), the indigenous peoples could adopt Catholicism without having to
give up completely on their own animistic beliefs because of the focus
on spirit in Catholicism and the figure of the devil, which they could
imbue with pantheistic traits. Other examples are more directly the
result of [[globalization]],
which has brought about a widespread taste for the 'cultural', as for
instance films like *Bride and Prejudice* (director Gurinder Chadha,
2005), which fuses Bollywood and Hollywood. The unequalness of the
transcultural is exemplified by singer Paul Simon's borrowing of African
music styles in the production of his bestselling album *Graceland*
(1986)---the people he borrowed from received nothing for their
contributions or their original ideas.
