[[Third Space]]

 A creative
space that lies between the discourse or position of the ruling subject
and the discourse or position of the
[[subaltern]] subject. This,
according to the term's originator [[Bhabha, Homi]], is inscribed
within the communicative situation itself. He explains that this is
never self-sufficient because there is always a gap between the
statement and its expression (this formulation draws on a variety of
[[post-structuralism]]
accounts of language, but principally that of [[Derrida, Jacques]] and his concept of
[[diff√©rance]]). The 'I'
who speaks and the 'I' who is spoken about never coincide. Once we
understand this, Bhabha argues, we cannot but realize that all claims
concerning the purity or originality of cultures are untenable by
definition. Urban geographer, [[Soja, Edward]] has adopted this term
as a means of articulating the problematic space of contemporary Los
Angeles, which, as his researches make plain, is neither as fully
American nor as fully First World as its boosters make it out to be,
because of the huge number of migrants living there as well as the
presence of sweatshops in the inner city. Soja takes it a step further
and considers the gap between Los Angeles as the producer of cinematic
representations and its representation in images, arguing that the
fantasy images of film feed into the way in which the city sees itself
and lives are lived there. Third Space has become an important term in
[[Postcolonial Studies]] for
thinking about geographical
[[hybridity]].
