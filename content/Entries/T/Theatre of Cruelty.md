[[Theatre of Cruelty]]

 French
poet and dramatist [[Artaud, Antonin]]'s proposal---put
forward in two short manifestos published together in *The Theatre and
its Double* (1970)---for the recovery of theatre's specific powers of
action and its own language. Theatre had to break with its subjugation
to the text, he argued, and find its own way of expressing itself, which
he thought would lie somewhere between gesture and thought. He didn't
want to dispense with spoken words altogether, but he argued that rather
than use words from known languages, theatre should use the language of
things, which would consist of vocalizations he called 'breath sounds'.
He also advocated the use of lighting and music as part of the
performance and not merely as an adjunct to it. The aim was to create a
theatre that was not focused around the psychological states of specific
characters and therefore beholden to an old-fashioned notion of what
theatre can be. Artaud was vehemently opposed to
[[realism]] in the theatre
for this reason. Like [[Brecht, Bertolt]], he insisted that
the way the actors moved themselves on stage had to be changed, so as to
break with the conventions of realism. By cruelty, then, Artaud meant
not sadism or horror as such, but a concentrated discipline,
attentiveness to every detail of the performance and a constant
vigilance against backsliding into the old way of doing things. For
Artaud cruelty is synonymous with lucidity. Although most theatre
critics and practitioners consider Artaud's proposals impossible to
stage in full---they are like the impossible-to-build designs of
conceptual architecture in this regard---this has in no way diminished
their importance or influence, particularly with radical and
experimental directors like Peter Brook and Richard Schechner whose work
was pushing the boundaries of the possible in any case.
