[[technics]]

 American
philosopher Lewis Mumford's term for the transformation of human
existence via the invention of machines, from the simplest levers
through to complex cities. French philosopher [[Stiegler, Bernard]] also uses this
term for his theory of the interrelatedness of humans and technology
developed at length in his three-volume work *La Technique et le temps*
(1994--2001). Drawing on the work of [[Heidegger, Martin]], Andr√©
Leroi-Gourhan, Gilbert Simondon, and Bertrand Gille, Stiegler argues
that temporality depends upon technology, that without the technological
means to measure time, the sense of passing time would not be possible.
Therefore insofar as temporality is intrinsic to what it means to be
human, the human is inseparable from the technological. To put it
another way, there is nothing essential to the human; the human always
requires a technological prosthesis to support it.
