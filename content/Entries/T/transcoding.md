[[transcoding]]

 American
cultural critic [[Jameson, Fredric]]'s term for his
comparative analysis of what he calls theoretical discourses or codes,
such as [[deconstruction]],
[[structuralism]],
[[post-structuralism]], and
so on. He suggests that the key issue to be decided is what kinds of
thoughts and ideas are possible in one theoretical code and not another
and what the relative advantages and disadvantages of each code are in
consequence. By the same token, this comparative viewpoint itself
implies still another code that is itself 'untranscendable' to use
Jameson's famous description of
[[Marxism]] from *The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act* (1981).
*See also* [[metacommentary]].
