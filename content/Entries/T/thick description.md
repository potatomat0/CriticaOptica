[[thick description]]

 In
cultural anthropology thick description is the analysis not just of a
particular statement or gesture, but the background and context needed
to understand the full meaning of that statement or gesture. The concept
was conceived by English analytic philosopher Gilbert Ryle, but its
influence in anthropology is due to its uptake by [[Geertz, Clifford]] in the programme
essay 'Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture'
which introduces his widely read book, *The Interpretation of Cultures:
Selected Essays* (1973). Geertz extrapolates from Ryle's rather forced
example of the complexity of determining the meaning of a wink---is it a
wink? a twitch? is it intended as a wink? or was it meant to be the
burlesque version of a wink?---the general hypothesis that
[[culture]] itself is a form
of ongoing interpretive practice. So, he argues, to understand another
culture what one has to first of all grasp is the manifold array of
codes and rules for making and interpreting meaning in that culture. His
implication is that one cannot understand another culture through remote
observation alone; one has to find the means of seeing it from the
perspective of those who belong to that culture. Only then will one be
in a position to know when an eye twitch is a wink and whether that wink
implies collusion.
