[[transsexual]]

 Originally a
medical term used to classify someone who wants to change their bodily
characteristics through surgery and other means so that it aligns with
their felt gender identity. Someone born with male genitals might thus
seek to have them surgically transformed into female genitals so that
their body matches their felt identity as female. It is underpinned by
the idea that sex and
[[gender]] do not
automatically coincide and that the one---sex---does not determine the
other---gender. It is thus a refutation of [[biological determinism]] and an argument
in favour of social
[[constructivism]]. Sex in
this instance stands for a biological category, a certain fact about the
body---in short, whether it has male or female genitalia, while gender
is seen as a subject position and an identity, both how one chooses to
live one's life and how one is compelled to love according to social
norms. Gender in this instance is a marker of identity coherence---one
is either male or female and not something else---that stands in
conflict with the felt incoherence of the body. Transsexual in this
context is not 'something else', a 'third sex' as it is sometimes
labelled, but the passage from an incoherent identity to a coherent
identity that may or may not result in surgical gender reassignment.
Transsexual tends to be caught up in a medicalized discourse of
'correction' and 'reassignment', which is one of the key reasons the
term [[transgender]] is
increasingly replacing it in contemporary gender studies discourse.
