[[talking cure]]

 Josef Breuer's
patient Fräulein Anna O (later identified as Bertha van Pappenheim),
whose case is analysed in the book Breuer co-authored with [[Freud, Sigmund]], *Studien über
Hysterie* (1895), translated as *Studies on Hysteria* (1955), famously
described her treatment this way because her therapy consisted largely
of talking about herself and her childhood, usually under hypnosis. It
has become a standard code word for
[[psychoanalysis]].
