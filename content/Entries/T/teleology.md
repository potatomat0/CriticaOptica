[[teleology]]

 The study of, and
the implicit assumption that everything has, a final purpose. Derived
from the Greek word '*telos*' meaning end, teleology is a philosophical
position premised on the idea that human action has a purpose. This
purpose is sometimes considered divine, where teleology is equated with
God's design, and may be compared to fatalism. But there is also a
secular version in which teleology and history are equated. On this view
of things, which is often described as a social Darwinist perspective,
all human society is constantly evolving towards some as yet unknown,
but certainly higher and more sophisticated form.
[[Tel Quel]] A French
literary and philosophical journal published between 1960 and 1983.
Edited by [[Sollers, Philippe]], the journal
published work by many of the leading figures of what would become known
as [[post-structuralism]], or
simply as [[theory]], and so
played a major part in both disseminating and popularizing theory.
[[Barthes, Roland]], [[Derrida, Jacques]], [[Foucault, Michel]], and [[Kristeva, Julia]] all published
with the journal---they all also broke with the journal at some point
for philosophical and more especially political reasons. The journal was
distinctive for its pugnacious stance: it overtly championed political
causes such as Maoism, and defended the [[nouveau roman]] against criticism,
but also attacked it for not being experimental enough, and favoured
[[psychoanalysis]] and
[[Marxism]] when these things
were out of fashion. It was undoubtedly one of the most influential
academic journals of its time.

Temporary
Autonomous Zone](#X2324115c9b2f9fe8277dc3d0c054fbb9917df73)
([[TAZ]]) Anarchist poet
and social activist Hakim Bey's radical proposal for a concept of
[[utopia]] suited to the
historical conditions of [[late capitalism]]. Conceived in the
late 1980s when the Cold War still dominated geopolitical thought and
the Internet was in its infancy, the temporary autonomous zone proposed
to deploy the resources of the latter in order to offer an alternative
political model to the capitalism/socialism binary underpinning the
former. Arguing that the all or nothing rhetoric of revolution paralyses
politics, because the sheer scale of the task of trying to change the
world inevitably overwhelms even the hardiest of activists, Bey instead
suggests that activism should look to insurrection as its model. Rather
than take power, as revolution demands, the TAZ looks simply to create a
space or enclave for an alternative to power. Inspired by
[[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[authority]]'s concept of
[[modernism]], though it
derives its historical precedents from seagoing pirates rather than
desert tribes, its logic anticipates the
anti-[[BWO]]
(World Trade
Organization) slogans that circulated in the late 1990s, e.g. 'one world
with many worlds in it' and 'another world is possible', in that it is
not concerned with seizing territory, but simply wants to mobilize
anything it can find to hand---art, ideas, slogans, festivals,
theatre---to open up a space for new ways of thinking and living. He
refers to this process as either 'ontological anarchy' or 'poetic
terrorism'. But it is also more radical than the anti-WTO movement in
that it wants to break with existing social structures, such as that of
the family, and it eschews permanence in favour of transience. Bey
insists that the TAZ is not a political doctrine and offers no programme
for creating it, claiming instead that as a kind of psycho-spiritual or
existentialist state it is always already being created (in this regard
it also anticipates [[fort/da]]
and [[drive]]'s concept of
the [[multitude]] and could
usefully be compared to Deleuze and Guattari's notion of the
[[rhizome]]).
