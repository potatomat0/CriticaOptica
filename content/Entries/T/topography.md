[[topography]]

In *Die Traumdeutung* (1900) , translated as *The Interpretation of Dreams*
(1953), [[Freud, Sigmund]]
borrows this term from geography (where it refers to a type of map that
distinguishes between features such as mountains and lakes and specifies
their exact height or depth), to describe his conception of the
psychical apparatus as consisting of three distinct regions: the
[[unconscious]], the
preconscious, and the conscious. Freud did not intend this to be a form
of anatomical localization, to specify one part of the brain as being
unconscious and another conscious, which is why he is careful to use the
term psychical apparatus to describe what he is talking about. He
adopted the notion of topography because his analysis of patients
suggested very strongly to him that the kinds of impulses, thoughts, and
wishes he associated with the unconscious occur on a different stage to
those of the conscious. This hypothesis is effectively the starting
premise of
[[psychoanalysis]]: the
unconscious is a different kind of psychical mechanism to the conscious
and its productions can only pass into the conscious if they are
distorted and transformed by the primary processes (i.e. the
[[dreamwork]]). Except for
the occasional, unwelcome intrusions, which Freud termed
[[parapraxis]] (better known
as 'Freudian slips'), the conscious is generally unaware of what is
happening in the unconscious, but the constant pressure of the
[[repression]] it has to
apply to remain ignorant takes its toll. Freud produced a second
topography late in his career replacing the terms unconscious,
preconscious, and conscious with the terms
[[id]],
[[ego]], and
[[superego]], but retaining
the idea of their spatial separation. The main difference, though,
between the two topographies is that in the second, Freud allowed that
certain psychical impulses may occur in two or more regions
simultaneously, whereas previously he had thought they originated in the
unconscious and migrated to the conscious.
