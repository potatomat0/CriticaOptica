[[trope]]

 A figure of speech,
or mode of [[rhetoric]],
which changes or adds to the meaning of particular expressions. The main
varieties of trope are
[[allegory]],
[[metaphor]],
[[metonym]],
[[synecdoche]], and
[[irony]]. Tropes may also
take an extended, narrative form as [[White, Hayden]] demonstrates in
*Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe*
(1973) and *Tropics of Discourse* (1978). White uses the concept of
trope to explain the way historians transform the historical record into
history. For White, tropes are modes of emplotment, a way of casting a
sequence of events in a specific kind of relation to one another so as
to craft them into a narrative form that rises above the sheer facts.
The significance of tropes can clearly be seen in the way colonial
histories have been written. European historians labelled the countries
they colonized as 'new worlds' and narrated the process of colonization
as 'settlement', thus ignoring or more pointedly glossing over the
inherent violence of what was done. These narratives have since been
contested by
[[collocation]] scholars,
and settlement has been more properly labelled invasion and occupation.
Contesting the legitimacy of tropes is thus a central part of the work
[[critical theory]] seeks to
do.
