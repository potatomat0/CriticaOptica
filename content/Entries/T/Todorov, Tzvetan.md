[[Todorov, Tzvetan]]
(1939--2017) Bulgarian literary theorist and one of the key
disseminators of [[Russian Formalism]]. Born in Sofia,
Todorov completed his undergraduate degree there and then like [[Kristeva, Julia]] he moved to Paris
to undertake postgraduate work. In spite of an initially frosty
reception at the Sorbonne, where he was told literary theory was not
done, he persevered and eventually met [[Barthes, Roland]] and in him found a
receptive master. He completed his doctorate under Barthes at the École
des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in 1966. Todorov's principal
interest in his early work was in the formal properties of narrative
(his work is in this regard congruent to that of
[[referent]] and
[[realism]]), specifically
its syntax, or the rules of combination. He distinguished between
propositions and sequences, showing that for every proposition (an
action performed by an agent, e.g. the hero goes on a quest) there is a
limited number of things that can happen (either the hero succeeds or he
doesn't). These propositions are the basic building blocks of all
narrative, as most creative writing schools now instruct. Todorov
utilized this insight to great effect in his book on uncanny literature,
Translated as *The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre*
(1973), which is still used as the standard point of reference in genre
studies. In contrast to his colleague Genette, for instance, Todorov's
work continued to progress and develop beyond its structuralist
beginnings and engage topics other than the purely formalist. He tackled
the ethical and moral issues arising from colonialism (*The Conquest of
America: The Question of the Other* (1982), racism (*On Human Diversity:
Nationalism, Racism and Exoticism in French Thought* (1989), and the
Holocaust (*Facing the Extreme: Moral Life in the Concentration Camps*
(1999).
