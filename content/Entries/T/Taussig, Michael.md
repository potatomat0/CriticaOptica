[[Taussig, Michael]]
 (1940--)


[[Marxism]] cultural
anthropologist. Born in Papua New Guinea and educated in Australia and
the UK, Taussig studied medicine at undergraduate level but did not
pursue a career as a general practitioner. Instead he completed a PhD in
medical anthropology. He is best known, however, for his accounts of
magical beliefs in South America, particularly his seminal work *The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America* (1980). Based on
extensive fieldwork amongst tin-miners in Columbia, Taussig showed the
way pagan beliefs adapt to accommodate changes in society, such as the
advent of capitalism. A highly prolific author, Taussig has written
several important books: *Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man: A
Study in Terror and Healing* (1987), *Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular
History of the Senses* (1993), and *Law in a Lawless Land: Diary of a
Limpieza in Colombia* (2003).
