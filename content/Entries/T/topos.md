[[topos]]

 The Greek word for
'place'. It is used in
[[rhetoric]] to denote common
motifs, such as the idea that a flower can signify both the beauty and
the brevity of life. It is also used in [[Cultural Studies]] to refer to places
emblematic of particular movements---e.g. the Bonaventure Hotel in Los
Angeles has been described as a topos of
[[postmodernism]] because of
[[Jameson, Fredric]]'s
discussion of it.
