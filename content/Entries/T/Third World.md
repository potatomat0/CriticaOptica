[[Third World]]

 Alternative
phrase in common use for the developing or underdeveloped parts of the
world. It was coined by French economist Alfred Sauvy in an article
published in *Observateur* in 1952 which compared the politically
non-aligned countries (i.e. countries that had not taken a side in the
Cold War) to the Third Estate (i.e. peasants and commoners) in France
during the Revolution. His point was that like the peasants, the people
of the Third World had very little material wealth, but had begun to
assert their right to and desire for a better share of global resources.
This became manifest as the process of
[[decolonization]] began in
earnest following the end of World War II. At the Bandung conference in
1955, at which the leaders of countries from Africa and Asia met to
discuss their collective future, and possible forms of cooperation and
collaboration between the 29 participating countries, the notion of the
Third World became a rallying cry of solidarity. It was used to signal
common cause and as an indictment on the First World (i.e. the former
colonial powers, the present-day G8 countries). In more recent times,
[[Postcolonial Studies]] has
rejected the use of the term Third World for being both too generalizing
and too demeaning. The argument against its use usually points out that
countries in the First World have sections in them that are as poor as
anywhere in the Third World (such as the garment district, or skid row,
in downtown Los Angeles), and Third World countries like India have
sections in them every bit as wealthy as First World cities (e.g.
Mumbai).
