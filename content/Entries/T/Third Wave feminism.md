[[Third Wave feminism]]

 A
movement for the renewal of
[[feminism]]'s original
project---i.e. equality between the sexes---expanded to incorporate
those women, particularly women of colour, and women from the [[Third World]], who felt excluded
from [[Second Wave feminism]]. Often conflated
with so-called
[[post-feminism]], although
it is not the same thing at all, Third Wave feminism has its roots in
the disappointments and conflicts which brought the Second Wave to a
halt. Writers like [[Anzald√∫a, Gloria]] and [[hooks, bell]] argued for a new
conception of feminist subjectivity that took account of
[[race]] as well as
[[class]] and
[[gender]]. In the public
sphere, feminism fought to retain the gains it had made, in the face of
an anti-equal rights onslaught by the Reagan and Thatcher
administrations in the US and UK respectively. The tipping point, so to
speak, was the way Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment against
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas were handled in 1991. In spite of
Hill's testimony, Thomas was nonetheless confirmed as a Supreme Court
judge, sparking Rebecca Walker (daughter of Alice Walker, the author of
*The Colour Purple* (1982) to write a stirring riposte for *Ms.*
magazine entitled 'I am the Third Wave' thus giving the movement a name.
