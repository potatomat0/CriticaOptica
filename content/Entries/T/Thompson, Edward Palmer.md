[[Thompson, Edward Palmer]]
(1924--93) British
[[Marxism]] cultural
historian and nuclear disarmament activist. Born in Oxford to parents
who were Methodist missionaries, he went to high school in Bath and
university at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. During World War II he
served in a tank corps in Italy. At Cambridge he joined the Communist
Party and in 1946 together with Christopher Hill, [[Hobsbawm, Eric]], and Rodney
Hilton, formed the Communist Party Historians Group, which established
its own highly influential journal *Past and Present*. It was the
publication in 1963 of *The Making of the English Working Class* that
brought Thompson widespread recognition as one of the key intellectuals
of the time. Like [[Hoggart, Richard]]'s *The Uses of
Literacy* (1957) and [[Williams, Raymond]]'s *Culture and
Society* (1958), *The Making of the English Working Class* set aside the
old model of culture which ignored the daily lives of the labouring
classes in favour of the pronouncements and peccadilloes of the
aristocracy, as though to say it is only kings and queens who have
culture and make history. It was for this reason, despite its focus on
seventeenth-century Britain, that Thompson's work proved to be of
enduring interest to [[Cultural Studies]], which is similarly
interested in [[everyday life]]. In the 1970s, having
moved from Cambridge to Warwick, from which he famously resigned in
protest at what he saw as its commercialization, Thompson made his
living as a freelance writer, producing short works on a wide variety of
historical and contemporary topics. He found true notoriety in 1978 with
the publication of *The Poverty of Theory*, a blistering, albeit
misdirected and intemperate, attack on
[[theory]], and particularly
on its then leading exponent [[Althusser, Louis]]. [[Anderson, Perry]] wrote an equally
scathing reply, *Arguments within English Marxism* (1980), demolishing
virtually every one of Thompson's points. From 1980 on, Thompson devoted
his attention and energy to the nuclear disarmament movement, writing
countless polemical pieces attacking the militarist ideology.
