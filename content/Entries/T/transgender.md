[[transgender]]

 A
[[gender]]
[[identity]] defined by
transitivity or fluidity in the movement between traditional male and
female gender identities. It is simultaneously not one gender and not
yet another gender, but a passage between the two. This passage may have
as its end point surgical gender reassignment, but this is not a
necessary condition. For some it is sufficient to occupy the desired
gender position. Transgender generally applies to people who identify as
a gender that is different from the biological
[[sex]] they were born with,
but its scope is much broader than that because it also encompasses
people who refuse all existing gender types. It is a paradoxical
category because it includes both those people who see themselves as
trapped in the 'wrong' body and seek to find ways to correct what they
see as 'nature's' mistake and those people who see all gender categories
as restrictive cultural constructs. These two positions are at odds with
one another because the one seeks to put an end to gender ambiguity
while the other seeks to extend and indeed intensify it. In this sense,
the category 'transgender' casts into doubt the category of gender
itself and is for that reason a highly useful critical term in gender
studies. Transgender is increasingly used in place of
[[transsexual]] because it
recognizes that gender identity is more fluid and problematic than the
original meaning of transsexual can accommodate.
