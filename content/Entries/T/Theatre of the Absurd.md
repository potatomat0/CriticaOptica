[[Theatre of the Absurd]]

 An
anti-political form of theatre that emerged in Europe in the 1950s,
largely as a rejection of [[Brecht, Bertolt]]'s [[Epic Theatre]]. Inspired by [[Jarry, Alfred]]'s
[[’pataphysics]], Franz
Kafka's bleak stories,
[[Dada]], and
[[Surrealism]], the Theatre
of the Absurd is [[nihilism]]
in its outlook. In this respect, it is congruent with
[[Absurdism]]'s
[[biopolitics]] view of the
world. It is typified by clever language play, which pushes language to
the point of non-meaning and nonsense, thereby exposing language's
capacity to betray its users. There was no coherent group of
practitioners who identified themselves with this garve, but the term is
generally applied to the following directors and playwrights: Samuel
Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Harold Pinter.
