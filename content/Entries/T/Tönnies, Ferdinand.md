[[Tönnies, Ferdinand]]
(1855--1936) German sociologist best known for the formative distinction
he drew between *Gemeinschaft* and *Gesellschaft* (community and
society), for which he is widely considered one of the 'fathers' of
sociology (along with
[[Durkheim, Émile]],
[[Simmel, Georg]], and Weber). Born
in Nordfriesland in Schleswig-Holstein, then under Danish rule but now
part of Germany, Tönnies's family were wealthy farmers. His family's
money enabled him to remain aloof from the academic world and
consequently his professional career progressed rather slowly. He didn't
attain a full professorship until three years before his retirement in
1913. He continued as a professor emeritus at the University of Kiel
until 1933 when the Nazi government forced him out because of his
earlier criticisms of them. A relatively prolific author, Tönnies is
nonetheless remembered for only one work, his first book: the seminal
*Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft* (1887), translated as *Community and
Society* (1957), still an essential cornerstone of any introductory
course on sociology. The distinction between community and society,
which Tönnies treated as ideal types or tendencies rather than actually
existing entities, distinguishes between social groups which are held
together by mutual bonds of filiation and friendship (community) and
those which are bound by mutual self-interest (society). The two types
of social group are approximations of village or country life
(community) and town or city life (society). Tönnies thought of these
two types of social groups as tendencies, which are present to a greater
or lesser degree in actual towns or cities. These tendencies were,
according to Tönnies, manifest in the way a particular social group
oriented itself towards social action. That is to say, is the glue
holding the social group together the product of 'natural' inclination,
or 'strategic' calculation.
