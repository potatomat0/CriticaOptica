[[Zhdanovism]]

 A shorthand term
for the doctrine governing all aesthetic production in the Soviet Union
laid down in 1948 by Andrei Zhdanov, a senior bureaucrat. It is in
effect a code word for any form of artistic prescription.
[[Žižek, Slavoj]] (1949--)
Slovenian [[Marxism]]
philosopher and
[[psychoanalysis]]. Known for
his uncanny ability to connect [[critical theory]] and popular culture
in a way that is both humorous and thought-provoking, Žižek is one of
the most high profile intellectuals in the world. An incredibly prolific
and wide-ranging author, his work is much in demand and he writes for a
variety of publications, from newspapers like *The Guardian* (UK) and
*London Review of Books*, to blogs and academic journals. Working in
several languages, it is one of Žižek's great gifts that he is almost
always able to give near instantaneous counter-intuitive critical
responses to world events. Having made the perverse counter-claim into
something of a personal trademark, he can be relied on to say the
opposite of what everyone else is saying. Žižek is not without his
critics or his faults, but is widely regarded as an essential voice of
dissidence.
Žižek was born in Ljubljana in what was Communist Yugoslavia but is now
the capital of Slovenia, into a middle-class family. He studied
philosophy and sociology at the University of Ljubljana and in 1971
gained a position there as an assistant researcher. Although Yugoslavia
was comparatively liberal for a socialist country, it still had its
hard-line elements, and Žižek was sacked in 1973 because his MA
dissertation was deemed to be 'non-Marxist'. He spent the next four
years in the Yugoslav national army, completing his obligatory national
service. In the late 1970s he was hired as a researcher at the Institute
of Sociology at the University of Ljubljana, enabling him to complete a
PhD on German idealism in 1981. He then studied psychoanalysis in Paris
with [[Lacan, Jacques]]'s
son-in-law, Jacques-Alain Miller, and completed his habilitation thesis
(on Lacan, [[genre]], and
Marx). Outside of academia, Žižek co-founded the Slovenian Liberal
Democratic Party and in 1990 stood for a seat in the four-member
collective Slovenian presidency and only narrowly missed gaining office.
The publication of *The Sublime Object of Ideology* in 1989, Žižek's
first work in English, was the major launching point of his career. It
set the pattern for his numerous future publications by applying a
mixture of Lacan and Hegel to a basically Marxist problematic: what is
[[ideology]] and how does it
work? Žižek defines ideology as the set of beliefs which glue society
together---these beliefs are often false, inconsistent and irrational,
but no less necessary for being so. For example, money requires our
belief in its value---it is literally a promissory note---to function,
in spite of the fact that our senses tell us it is intrinsically
worthless. The point is, even though we know better, even though we know
the truth, we act as though the truth were otherwise, and this leads
Žižek to propose the provocative thesis that it is
[[fantasy]] that supports
reality (and not the other way round). Fantasy is a conscious disavowal
of a known truth coupled with an
[[unconscious]] (and
therefore stronger) belief in an alternate truth. Fantasy is faced
constantly by the threat of dissolution should it come into contact with
the [[real]]; therefore,
[[culture]] must find ways of
staving off that eventuality. Žižek's best work details how this process
works and fails at the same time.
