[[zeitgeist]]

 A German word
that translates literally as 'spirit of the time'. It is used to
describe social, cultural, and intellectual trends, but it also implies
that there is some kind of superhuman 'force' at work influencing the
actions and decisions of entire peoples. While such a phantasmal force
is difficult to document empirically, the fact that something like it
must exist can be seen in the various fads that every historical period
seems to know. Why people en masse did one thing rather than another at
a certain point in time is very often accounted for in terms of
zeitgeist.
