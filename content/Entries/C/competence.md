[[competence]]

 and performance
A binary distinction between the ability to speak a language
(competence) and the actual instances of that ability (performance)
proposed by American linguist [[Chomsky, Noam]]. This distinction
can be applied to virtually any kind of skilled behaviour. The interest
in using this distinction arises from the fact that performance can vary
considerably even when competence is uniformly distributed.
