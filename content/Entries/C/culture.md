[[culture]]

 A set of beliefs,
[[practices]], rituals, and
traditions shared by a group of people with at least one point of common
[[identity]] (such as their
ethnicity, [[race]], or
[[rationality]]). At its core
is the sense that it is different from nature in that it is a product of
conscious choice and not the
[[instinct]]. But as authors
like [[Haraway, Donna]] have
shown, the nature/culture divide is difficult to sustain. A wide range
of disciplines---predominantly anthropology, archaeology, [[Cultural Studies]], history and
sociology---make use of the concept of culture, each one adding its own
qualification, making it problematic to say that what is meant by this
word is exactly the same in any two disciplines. Obviously there are
common themes and the differences tend to be related to scope, and turn
on the question of whether or not a limit can be placed on what counts
as cultural. In the social sciences, particularly history and sociology,
culture has usually been opposed to
[[society]], and given a
lower status, as it was thought to refer to pastimes rather than the
serious business of holding the collectivity together. However, the
general trend with this term, even in the social sciences, has been
expansive, so that even within the confines of specific disciplines it
has been enlarged to encompass virtually every facet of human behaviour.
And in recent times it has overtaken society as the dominant term as
doubts have grown as to the existence or even the possibility of
society. Culture has thus come to stand for 'weak' rather than 'strong'
ties between people within a given collectivity. The types of cultures
that are now said to exist are innumerable---there is banking culture,
work culture, music culture, sports culture, and so on. In the
humanities, from the time of Matthew Arnold in the late nineteenth
century up until very late in the twentieth century, culture referred to
artistic production of all types, and was further classified into
categories of 'high' and 'low' reflecting the perceived relative
aesthetic merit of a particular work. The advent of Cultural Studies in
1950s Britain began to change that, as it combined ways of thinking
about culture from history and sociology and conceived of culture as the
glue holding society together. Culture came to refer to any form of
creative production, from the self-consciously artistic work of
professional artists to the relatively banal
[[habitus]] and practices of
[[everyday life]]. It is this
sense of the word that has lately become dominant. The principal
theoretical problem culture raises is one of reproduction: why do people
adhere to a given culture and to what extent are their actions
determined by this?
