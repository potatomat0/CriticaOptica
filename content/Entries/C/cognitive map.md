[[cognitive map]]

 **1.** A
concept conceived by the American urbanist Kevin Lynch in his book *The Image of the City* (1960) to account for the way city residents use
landmarks rather than maps to spatially orient themselves. Lynch
researched this by stopping people in the street in three different
cities---Boston, Jersey City, and Los Angeles---and asking them to draw
impromptu maps of the city. What he found was that residents in dense
cities like Boston, which has a great number of well-known and clearly
defined landmarks (e.g., the Charles River, Faneuil Hall, and Boston
Common), were more readily able to complete this task than residents in
dispersed cities like Los Angeles, which at the time had relatively few
such landmarks. Landmarks make the city 'imageable' he argued, meaning
they enable residents and visitors alike to form images in their mind of
the city as a whole. He concluded from this that cities require
landmarks, real or artificial, in order to make them habitable.
**2.** In his essay 'Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late
Capitalism' (1984), [[Jameson, Fredric]] adapts this
concept to characterize the contribution cultural texts---particularly
film and literature---make to our orientation in the world as a whole.
Jameson combines Lynch with
[[actant]] and
[[Althusser, Louis]] to suggest that
contemporary texts, in mapping our place in the world, provide a
representation of our imaginary relation to the real conditions of our
existence. His principal argument is that since the advent of
[[globalization]] (which he
equates with the enormous expansion of capitalism following the end of
World War II), the world has become too complicated to represent by
means of standard mimetic forms. This orientation in the world is, for
Jameson, a synonym for [[class consciousness]]. *See also*
