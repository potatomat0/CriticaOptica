[[cosmopolitanism]]

 A mode or
'way' of being in the world commensurate with the condition of
[[globalization]],
characterized by a high level of mutual respect for the rights of others
and a generalized tolerance of ethnic, cultural, political and national
differences. It is in this sense a paradoxical concept because it
implies identification with one's difference or singularity and an
empathetic acknowledgement of one's sameness. It can in this sense be
compared to pluralism and internationalism. The word derives from a
combination of the Greek for world or universe (*Kosmos*) and the city
or polity (*polis*) and is said to originate with the founding father of
the Cynics, Diogenes of Sinope who famously declared himself to be a
'citizen of the world' (*kosmopolitÄ“s*), implying that he answered to a
'higher' power than that of the city-state to whom his allegiance was in
fact owed. Cosmopolitanism is a
[[utopia]] concept inasmuch
that it cannot be legislated into being and nowhere exists in its pure
state, though it is often claimed that so-called 'world cities' like
London, New York, Paris, and Istanbul embody many of its ideals. It has
attracted commentary from some of the finest commentators in western
philosophy from [[Kant, Immanuel]] to [[Derrida, Jacques]], but it is not
without its ambiguities.
