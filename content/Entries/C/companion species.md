[[companion species]]

[[Haraway, Donna]] 's term for the
mutually dependent---Haraway's term is 'obligatory'---relationship
between human animals and certain kinds of non-human animals. Companion
species differs from companion animals (such as guide dogs for the
blind) in this crucial respect: it implies a two-way dependency. Haraway
argues that neither human animals nor non-human animals pre-exist their
relationship to one another. This is because the relationship is
productive or co-constitutive. Haraway takes this line of thought back
to the origin of both humans and dogs and argues that their development
has to be seen as an instance of co-evolution. Neither species would be
what it is today without the other. Humans are in a state of coexistence
with countless microorganisms, Haraway argues, so 'our' sense of 'self'
needs to be rethought (she describes this as a fourth Copernican turn,
adding to three already enumerated by
[[Freud, Anna]]) as composite of
our 'self' with 'others'. She borrows Lynn Margulis's concept of
[[sympoiesis]] to describe
this process as a form of 'making-with' or 'we' creation, as opposed to
[[autopoiesis]], Humberto
Maturana and Francisco Varela's better-known term for 'self' creation.
Haraway rejects the idea that the relationship between companion species
is 'touchy-feely'. It is, rather, multiform, unfinished, and
consequential. She speculates that the relationship can be thought of in
terms of love, providing it is understood that it is a form of love
built on mutual trust, working together, accomplishment, and play,
rather than passive conceptions of romantic love. Interestingly, it is
important to Haraway that the companion species should not be considered
a pet or be anthropomorphized in any way. This includes the idea of
considering animals to be innocent, which she describes as an
exterminationist viewpoint. Human animals and non-human animals are and
remain irreducibly other in Haraway's conception of them, an outlook she
admits is theological in its formulation. This does not mean they cannot
communicate; on the contrary, it means that their communication is the
only 'true' kind of communication because it bridges an irreducible
divide. She describes the interrelation between human animals and
non-human animals in various ways, using a variety of borrowed terms,
e.g. emergent ontology, ontological choreography, partial connections,
and, perhaps most satisfyingly, a dance.
