[[condensation]]
(*Verdichtung*) One of four key mechanisms of [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s concept of
[[dreamwork]]. It is also to
be found at work in the symptom-formation of both
[[syncretism]] and
[[neurosis]] and, as Freud
showed in *Der Witz une seine Beziehung zum Unbewussten* (1905),
translated as *Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious* (1960), it
is essential to the functioning of jokes. First introduced in *Die Traumdeutung* (1900), translated as *The Interpretation of Dreams*
(1953), condensation takes three basic forms: (i) a series of elements
of a dream-thought or multiple repetitions of the same dream-thought can
be condensed into one; (ii) a variety of otherwise disparate and
different dream-thoughts may be combined into a single composite image;
(iii) the differences between dream-thoughts may be blurred so as to
enhance the appearance of their connectedness. As with
[[displacement]], another of
the key dreamwork mechanisms, condensation presupposes that the
[[affect]] (*Affekt*)
associated with the representations (*Vorstellung*) we make to ourselves
of the [[instinct]] is
independent of that representation: in this way it is possible for the
[[liminality]] charge of
several such images to be compressed and not lose any of their power.
All dreams are works of condensation inasmuch that they may only last a
moment, yet contain within them substantial amounts of psychical
information as becomes obvious when all the associations that can be
made with a dream are teased out in detail.
