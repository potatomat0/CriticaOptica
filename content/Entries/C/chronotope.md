[[chronotope]]

 Literally
'time-place', it denotes the intrinsic interconnection of these two
dimensions, but also connotes an author's specific attitude to the
passing of time and the location of events in a narrative. The
chronotope, according to its inventor Russian linguist and literary
critic [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]],
is a formally constitutive category of literature, which means that it
is a feature of every piece of literature. In other words, literature
cannot *not* have a chronotopic dimension, but this dimension may vary
quite considerably from example to example. Variations in the formation
of chronotopes can be used to specify genre, Bakhtin suggests. His
extensive historical account of the development of different types of
chronotope in *The Dialogic Imagination* (1981) offers a vivid
illustration of the importance of this concept. As he shows, in
classical Greek narratives the hero often spends years away from home,
having adventure after adventure, all without ever aging and when he
returns home his youthful bride is still as youthful as she ever was.
The departure from the constrictions of biological time is necessary for
the type of tale being told and its peculiar effects clearly depend on
this departure too. Chronotope should not be confused with duration or
setting, which are surface features. *See also*
