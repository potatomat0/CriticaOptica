[[Canguilhem, Georges]]
(1904--95) French philosopher and historian of science. Born in
Castelnaudary in the Languedoc region, Canguilhem studied at the École
Normale Supérieure in the same year as Raymond Aron, Paul Nizan, and
[[Sartre, Jean-Paul]].
Graduating in 1927, he held a series of jobs in lycées in regional
France, the last of which was in Toulouse. From 1940--1944 he was active
in the Resistance, though in a humanitarian rather than combat capacity
(he provided clandestine medical treatment, an offence punishable by
death nevertheless), for which he was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He
began his study of medicine in Toulouse and finished it in Strasbourg,
submitting a thesis entitled: *Essai sur quelques problèmes concernant
le normal et le pathological* (1943), translated as *The Normal and the
Pathological* (1978). He argued that the normal and pathological differ
quantitatively, not qualitatively, that the difference between the two
is not to be found in their essence, but rather the distribution of
their elements (putting it crudely, a single pimple is normal, but
hundreds of pimples is pathological). As a historian of science,
Canguilhem was centrally concerned with what [[Bachelard, Gaston]] called the
[[epistemological break]],
that is, the radical shift from one conception of science to another.
Canguilhem is also notable in critical theory for his early recognition
of the importance of scholars such as [[Lacan, Jacques]] and [[Foucault, Michel]] and the
assistance he gave to their careers. In 1956 he gave a lecture at the
Collège Philosophique criticizing his school friend Daniel Lagache, a
pre-eminent psychologist, famously saying psychology was equivalent to
philosophy minus its rigour, ethics minus its demands, and medicine
without verification. He objected to the way the latter's project of
unifying psychology and psychoanalysis seemed to lend itself to a kind
of instrumentalism that would enable governmental interference in the
very psychic lives of individuals. This attack on behavioural psychology
created an opening for Lacan's more individualistic psychoanalysis.
Similarly, he directed Foucault's thesis and then later advocated his
candidature to the Collège de France.
