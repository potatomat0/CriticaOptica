[[Césaire, Aimé]] 
(1913--2008)


Francophone poet and activist, Césaire was one of the key thinkers
behind the [[négritude]]
movement. Born in Martinique, he went to Paris in 1931 on a scholarship,
where with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Léon Damas he founded *L'Étudiant
noir* (The Black Student). He returned to Martinique to teach in
1939---one of his students was [[Fanon, Frantz]], who would go on to
write a series of powerful anti-colonial books. He also became close to
the self-appointed pope of
[[Surrealism]], [[Breton, André]], who spent part of
World War II in Martinique. In 1945, as a member of the Communist Party,
Césaire was elected mayor of Fort-de-France. In the following year he
helped draft the departmentalizing laws France put in place for its
various colonies, for which he was later criticized by pro-independence
thinkers and activists. Similarly, he was heavily criticized by the
[[Creoleness]] writers for
the fact that he always wrote in French, and never Creole, which is the
first language for most Martinicans. Following Stalin's death in 1953,
Césaire became disenchanted with communism, particularly its Stalinist
variant, writing a stirring denunciation of it in a text that has also
become a cornerstone of [[Postcolonial Studies]]---*Discours sur le
colonialisme* (1955), translated as *Discourse on Colonialism* (2001).
After the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, Césaire resigned from the
Communist Party, but he remained active in politics until 2001. He wrote
powerful biographies of black revolutionary leaders Toussaint Louverture
(who led a slave uprising in Haiti in 1791) and Patrice Lumumba (who
became the first Prime Minister of the newly decolonized Congo 1960),
the latter in the form of a play. He also wrote an adaptation of
Shakespeare's *Tempest*, highlighting the role of Caliban. But he will
probably always be best remembered for his magnificent Surrealist poem
*Cahier d'un retour au pays natal* (1939), translated as *Notebook of a
Return to My Native Land* (2001), which functioned as négritude's poetic
manifesto. In honour of his memory, and as a measure of his contribution
to his country as both politician and poet, Martinique named its
principal airport after him.
