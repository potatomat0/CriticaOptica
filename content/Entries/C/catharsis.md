[[catharsis]]

 A Greek word from
a verb meaning 'to purify', 'to cleanse', or even 'to purge', used in
drama studies to describe a peak moment in a play when a sequence is
brought to a close in such a way as to prompt laughter, tears, or some
other form of affective and emotional release. The term was first used
by Aristotle in his *Poetics*, which is generally thought to have been
written in reply to Plato's hostile view of poetry and drama as
something that induces hysteria in men. Borrowing the term from
medicine, where it was used to describe menstruation, Aristotle argued
that, contrary to Plato, poetry and drama enable men to expel their
hysterical emotions, effectively making them stronger not weaker.
