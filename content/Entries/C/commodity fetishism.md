[[commodity fetishism]]

 The
mistaken view that the value of a commodity is intrinsic and the
corresponding failure to appreciate the investment of labour that went
into its production. [[Marx, Karl]] created this term,
borrowing the notion of the fetish from anthropology, where it refers to
a sacred or symbolic object that according to its worshippers has
supernatural power. For example, in certain indigenous cultures in
Australia it is believed that a 'witch doctor' can point a bone at a
person and thereby bring about their death---such a bone is a fetish.
Commodities are fetishes in this same sense because by power of our
belief in them we create an obscure hierarchy of value that rates a
diamond over fresh water (to use Adam Smith's famous example from *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), in spite of the fact that the diamond serves
little or no purpose. By the same token, as with the witch doctor's
bone, it isn't clear to the people who believe in commodities why they
should believe in them, nor how they came to occupy the position they
presently enjoy. Diamonds might be valuable because they are rare, but
that does not by itself explain why society should choose to prize them
so highly. Not only are there similarly rare items that might have been
seized upon, there is no intrinsic reason why rarity itself should
matter as much as it does. Commodity fetishism can also be understood in
terms of social relations: neither the producer nor the consumer of a
commodity has a necessary or full relation with the other. The
fetishization of the commodity shields us from
[[alienation]]. [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s use of the term
[[shifter]], which occurs
later than Marx's, also borrows from anthropology. Freudo-Marxian
theorists like [[Žižek, Slavoj]] have combined the
psychoanalytic definition of fetish with Marx's own to create a theory
of the commodity that uses the notion of
[[fantasy]] to explain its
peculiar power to deceive. Commodity fetishism is an important concept
in [[Marxism]] and so-called
post-Marxist theory: It is central to the work of [[Lukács, György]], particularly his
concept of [[reification]];
it is also central to the work of [[Debord, Guy]], who famously
argued the final form of the commodity would be the image; and it is
central to [[Baudrillard, Jean]]'s theory of
[[consumer society]].
