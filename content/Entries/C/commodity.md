[[commodity]]

 An object or
process produced for the purpose of exchange or sale rather than
personal consumption or use by the producer. A key concept in [[Marx, Karl]]'s work, the commodity
is defined by him as having a dual character consisting of two very
different types of value: use-value (the satisfaction of a particular
human need) and exchange-value (what it can be exchanged for). Value is
measured in terms of how much labour goes into producing a particular
item. In this sense, the commodity can be seen as so much stored or as
Marx put it 'dead' labour. From a
[[Marxism]] perspective, the
most important commodity of all is labour itself, that which the worker
sells to the owners of the means of production, because of its ability
to create value. What is sometimes referred to as
[[modernity]] is in reality
the historic shift in western countries towards an economy organized
around the manufacture of commodities.
