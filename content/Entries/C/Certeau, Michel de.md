[[Certeau, Michel de]]
(1925--86) French religious historian and cultural critic. He is
especially well known for his critique of
[[historiography]] and his
analyses of the [[practices]]
of [[everyday life]]
(particularly its spatial dimension) which he undertook in the middle
part of his career. The work he did in the early and later parts of his
career are less well known, especially in Anglophone countries, though
no less significant or important.
After studying philosophy and the classics at the universities of Lyon
and Grenoble, Certeau entered the Society of Jesus at the age of 25.
Ordained into the Catholic priesthood in 1956, he went on to complete a
doctorate in religious history at the Sorbonne in 1960. Certeau's
principal theoretical interest in the early years of his career was the
question of why we need history in the first place. Rather than inquire
into the ideological meanings of histories, Certeau asked: What specific
cultural need does history fulfil? Using as his model
[[Freud, Anna]]'s concept of
[[dreamwork]], Certeau argued
that history should be seen as a kind of machine for easing the anxiety
most westerners seem to feel in the face of death. By speaking of the
past in the way it does, history raises the spectre of our inevitable
demise within a memorial framework that makes it appear we will live
forever after all. History is not, in other words, an innocent or
straightforward documenting of the past, but an integral component of
the structuring of the present. The main essays from this period were
later collected in *L'écriture de l'histoire* (1975) translated as *The Writing of History* (1988).
Then in [[May ’68]] the
streets of Paris erupted in a paroxysm of student and blue-collar
protest. Certeau later described his personal experience of the 'events
of May' (as they are often euphemistically called) as 'shattering'. In
trying to theorize what happened during the long weeks of strikes and
street protests, Certeau drew a distinction between law and
[[authority]], arguing that
although law prevailed during the course of the events of May authority
was diminished. When authority is lost, he argued, law has only the
naked exercise of violence at its disposal. Certeau's work on May 1968,
was written as an immediate response to what was happening on the
streets of Paris. It was initially published in the monthly magazine
*Études*, published by the Society of Jesus, and later printed in
pamphlet form as *La prise de parole* (1968), translated as *The Capture
of Speech and Other Political Writings* (1997). It inaugurated a change
of direction in Certeau's career which saw him move away from questions
of history to more contemporary issues.
This new direction led to the work for which Certeau is best known,
particularly in [[Cultural Studies]], namely his writings
on everyday life: *L'Invention du quotidien 1. arts de faire* (1980),
translated as *The Practice of Everyday Life* (1984) and *L'Invention du
quotidien 2. habiter, cuisiner* (1980), translated as *The Practice of
Everyday Life Volume 2: Living and Cooking* (1998). The second volume
was written in collaboration with his research associates Pierre Mayol
and Luce Giard. A third volume on
[[futurology]] was planned,
but never completed. Certeau proposed that everyday life could be seen
as a balance between two types of practices which he termed [[symptomatic reading]]: the one
referring to the set of practices Foucault theorized as
[[discipline]] and the other
being a kind of anti-discipline or
[[resistance]].
The final period of Certeau's career was something of a return to
origins, or a closing of a circle. Returning to France after nearly a
decade abroad, teaching at the University of California, San Diego,
Certeau revisited the topic with which his career began, namely
seventeenth-century French Mysticism. Completed shortly before his
death, this two volume work, *La Fable mystique* (1982, 1986),
translated as *The Mystic Fable: Volume One: The Sixteenth and
Seventeenth Centuries* (1992), and *The Mystic Fable: Volume Two: The
Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries* (2015), used
[[semiotics]] to argue that
the discourse of mysticism exhausted itself because its project of
trying to resurrect the word of God in an era that no longer knew God
simply could not be sustained. Through its bold linguistic experiments,
Mysticism could occasionally evoke the essential mystery of God, but it
could not convert that into an enduring presence.
Underpinning the second and third periods was Certeau's unfinished
project on the anthropology of belief, or what he also termed
[[heterology]]. This project
would in all likelihood have constituted a fourth period, but was cut
short by his untimely death. There are three published essays from this
project which give us a sense of what the finished work might have been
like. They deal with three forerunners to modern anthropology, namely
Montaigne, Léry and Lafitau, and their encounter with the New World.
