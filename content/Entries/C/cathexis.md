[[cathexis]]

 The standard
translation used in English (although it is in fact a Greek word) of
[[Freud, Sigmund]]'s concept
of '*Besetzung*', which in German ranges in meaning from military
occupation of a town to filling a bus. Freud's translator James Strachey
took the term from Greek, contrary to Freud's own practice of using
ordinary words. In Freud's work cathexis refers to the process of
libidinal energy---i.e. affective, emotional, as well as sexual energy
drawn from within the
[[psyche]]---being attached
to a specific [[object]]. A
shoe [[fetishism]], then, to
take an extreme example, is somebody whose cathexis is directed at
shoes. The French translation of '*Besetzung*' as '*investissement*'
(investment) is in many ways a happier choice as it captures Freud's
sense that cathexis is an investment of psychical energy in a specific
object. It should in this sense be contrasted with mere excitation,
which is spontaneous and instinctual and not in receipt of input from
the unconscious.
