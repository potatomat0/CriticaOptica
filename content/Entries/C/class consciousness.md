[[class consciousness]]

 The
collective awareness of both a common material situation and a common
set of interests arising out of that situation. It also entails the
perception of a common enemy and is in this regard a cornerstone of what
[[Marx, Karl]] referred to as
[[class struggle]]. According
to Marx, a [[class]] only
truly becomes a class when it is conscious of its situation and
acknowledges the implications of a shared identity. Class in the general
sense of a group of people with common material circumstances is
referred to as a class-in-itself by Marx, but once it develops
consciousness and ceases to be passive with respect to its interests it
becomes a class-for-itself. Marx tended to think class consciousness
would occur more or less spontaneously once people had been made aware
of their true situation, which is to say once the veil of [[false consciousness]] had been
lifted. History does not bear this out and later theorists, such as
Lenin and Mao, usually insist that class consciousness must be produced.
The implication, though, is that class consciousness amounts to a
willingness to take action to change the situation by revolutionary
means. Again, history does not bear this out, so theorists like [[Hardt, Michael]] and [[Negri, Antonio]] have suggested that
a shift in class consciousness is already a revolution and that there is
no need for armed insurrection if people think differently about how
they want the world to be organized.
