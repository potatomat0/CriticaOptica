[[complexity theory]]

 A general
term for a wide range of scientific research in two key problematics:
(i) the interconnectedness of the apparently unconnected (e.g., what
effect does a butterfly flapping its wings in Beijing have on weather in
London?); (ii) the emergence of change. Complexity in this context does
not mean complicated because complex systems can in fact be relatively
simple; rather it means that a particular phenomenon, such as air
quality, cannot be considered in isolation from a diverse range of other
factors, which in this case might include prevailing winds, the location
of heavy industry, and so on. Research in this field aims to identify
the critical causal agents in a particular system and separate out that
which is accidental, or just background noise. In [[critical theory]], complexity theory is
utilized to engage cultural and social questions. For instance, it has
been used by Manuel DeLanda to analyse the formation of cities. *See also* [[non-linear system]].
