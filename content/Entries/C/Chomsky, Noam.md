[[Chomsky, Noam]]
 (1928--)


American linguist, cognitive psychologist, philosopher and political
activist. It's almost as if Chomsky has had two separate careers (both
of them luminous) because his linguistics work is so complex it is
difficult to imagine him being able to write for a popular audience and
yet from the time of the Vietnam War, which he vehemently opposed, that
is precisely what he has managed to do. Consequently he is one of the
most widely cited and widely known scholars alive today. That said, in
the academic world his name remains very closely associated with
generative grammar, which was his invention.
Born in Philadelphia in the US to immigrant parents---his father was
from the Ukraine and his mother from Belarus---he was raised in a family
that consciously immersed itself in Hebrew culture and literature, in
spite of the blatant anti-Semitism they encountered in their largely
Catholic neighbourhood. His father was a renowned Hebrew scholar with a
strong interest in politics---he was a member of the Industrial Workers
of the World (or 'Wobblies' as they were affectionately known)---and an
obvious influence. Chomsky went to high school in Philadelphia and
completed his BA and PhD at the University of Pennsylvania. While
writing his PhD he was supported by a fellowship at Harvard. On
graduation in 1955 he took a job with MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) and has worked there ever since.
His first book, a reworked version of his dissertation, *Syntactic Structures* (1957), was a watershed in linguistics. Chomsky sought to
shift the emphasis in linguistics from the study of existing examples of
language use with a view to describing the regular patterns contained
therein to the more speculative matter of how language users know how to
use language in the first place. This ability to use languages, which he
labels [[competence]] in
contrast to performance which refers to the actual use of language, is,
he claims, innate, meaning all humans have it even if they don't know
it. Otherwise, he argues, we could not explain how it is possible for
children to learn language so quickly. Thus, in a famous review of
[[behaviourism]] psychologist
B. F. Skinner's *Verbal Behaviour* (1957) published in 1959, Chomsky
rejected the stimuli-response model of language acquisition and use.
Human language, in contrast to the language of animals (e.g. the dance
bees perform to inform the rest of the hive where the honey is), is
'open', and characterized by creativity and transformation (hence
Chomsky's theory is sometimes referred to as 'transformational
grammar').
In 1967, Chomsky contributed an essay to the *New York Review of Books*
entitled 'The Responsibility of Intellectuals' which attracted
international attention. Inspired by Dwight MacDonald's essays about
World War II which asked whether and to what extent the people of the
belligerent countries are responsible for the actions their governments
take, Chomsky argues that it is only those people who actively resist
allowing their government to act in a way they find morally
reprehensible who can say they are without responsibility for what is
committed in their name. It is a standard that Chomsky holds himself to:
his means of taking action has been to work tirelessly to expose
government (particularly, but not limited to, the US government)
cover-ups, deceptions, and falsehoods in both domestic and foreign
policy. Apparently blessed with an indefatigable capacity for work,
Chomsky has written an average of one book a year for the past 30 years
dealing with this subject. The best known of these are: *American Power
and the New Mandarins* (1969), *Year 501: The Conquest Continues*
(1993), *Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance*
(2003), and *Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on
Democracy* (2006).
A controversial figure, Chomsky's views are not universally shared, or
without their particular problems, but by his persistence in exposing
political malfeasance he has surely helped in some measure to make the
world a better place.
