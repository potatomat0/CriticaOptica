[[contrapuntal reading]]
Borrowed from music, where it refers to the relationship between themes
(e.g. the relation between the famous 'da-da-da-dum' in Beethoven's
*Fifth Symphony* and its subsequent exploration), this term is used by
[[Said, Edward]] in *Culture and Imperialism* (1993) to describe the relationship (in what he calls
the cultural [[archive]])
between narratives set in metropolitan centres, or at least in the
countryside, of the dominant colonial nations such as England and
France, and the colonies upon which the great powers depended for their
wealth. His key example is Jane Austen's *Mansfield Park* (1814), which
is about an estate owned by the Bertram family whose wealth derives from
sugar plantations in Antigua. But as Said notes, there is almost no
mention of Antigua in the novel, despite the fact that in a structural
sense the story depends on it because without their holdings in the
colonies the Bertrams would neither be so rich as they are, nor obliged
to spend so much time away from the estate, thus opening up the
narrative possibilities the novel explores. Said's strategy, then, is to
read the novel in the light of this structural dependency and read the
forgotten other back into the text.
