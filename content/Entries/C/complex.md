[[complex]]

 A crucial concept
in [[Jung, Carl]]'s analytic
psychology. A complex is an assemblage of images, ideas, associations
with a consistent emotional tone, gravitating around one or more
[[archetype]]. Complexes are
the personifications of the archetypes, they are what the psyche knows
and sees of the archetypes. This notion has passed into popular
discourse and the connection to Jung is very often unknown. The best
known and mostly wide recognized examples of complexes, after the
'Oedipal complex' ([[Freud, Anna]]
borrowed the term from Jung) are the 'father complex' and the 'mother
complex'---what these point to is the fact that our relationship to
certain people can, for a variety of radically differing reasons,
resemble and share many of the same characteristics as our relation with
our parents. Perhaps the most important implication, though, of the
notion of the complex is that it presupposes that the self is neither
unified nor singular but always multiple and in a state of flux.
