[[cinema-vérité]]
(film-truth) A documentary style of film-making in which, according to
Russian director Dziga Vertov (who originally coined the term in 1940),
there are no actors, no sets, no scripts, and no acting. The objective
of *cinema-vérité* is to capture
[[everyday life]] reality on film.
The camera supposedly acts as an innocent recording device, allowing
subjects to speak for themselves. So *cinema-vérité* treats editing and
staging as distortions---albeit inevitable---of reality, and these
typical aspects of film-making are deliberately kept to a minimum. It
might seem that so-called 'reality TV' is simply a glitzy version of
*cinema-vérité*, but the truth is that these are highly staged and
carefully edited programmes with very little interest in objectivity. A
better example is Michael Apted's remarkable *Up* series of documentary
films, which began in 1963 with a series of short interviews with 14
seven-year-old children and has been followed up every 7 years since,
thus creating an astonishing 42-year record of the changing lives of a
cross section of Britain.
