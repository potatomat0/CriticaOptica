[[cognitive estrangement]]

 A
concept derived by Darko Suvin from [[Russian Formalism]]'s notion of
[[ostranenie]] and [[Brecht, Bertolt]]'s closely related
(but [[Marxism]] inflected)
notion of the
[[estrangement-effect]] in
his *Metamorphoses of Science Fiction* (1979), a
[[structuralism]] attempt to
distinguish the genre of science fiction writing from other forms of
fiction. As [[Jameson, Fredric]] points out in
*Archaeologies of the Future* (2005), this is a rather exclusive
definition, which emphasizes the rational scientific dimension of
science fiction and rigorously excludes the kinds of flights of fancy
associated with fantasy fiction. For Suvin, the key to cognitive
estrangement is the presence in a story or novel of what he calls a
'novum', that is a device or machine that is absolutely new and whose
presence compels us to imagine a different way of conceiving our world.
