[[Cixous, Hélène]]
 (1937--)


French feminist philosopher, poet, playwright, and novelist. For Cixous,
language is trapped in a male or more specifically patriarchal economy,
but within it there is the possibility of a female economy, which can be
accessed via experimental writing she calls [**écriture
féminine*](#X17510d4ea6358c0e40f341f6ad47f16190cf3f6). It is another
form of writing, a writing both of and in the space of the
[[Other]] (a space Cixous
defines as that of the
[[real]] and the
[[body]]). Cixous does not
offer a specific theory of *écriture féminine*; indeed she says
*écriture féminine* is precisely the untheorizable, the uncodifiable,
the almost but not quite unsayable. Rather, *écriture féminine*, is a
practice, or an experiment. It depends, too, Cixous insists, on what one
might term a freely bisexual (in Freud's sense) attitude to both sex and
gender, i.e., an openness towards the simultaneous presence of both
sexes in the mind at all times. Creativity, she says, is impossible
without this openness to ambiguity and insofar as women are more willing
to admit to psychic bisexuality than men, creative writing itself is
feminine. Women are more open to otherness than men, according to
Cixous, by virtue of their bodies, or rather the gender specific
experiences their bodies make available to them, e.g. birth, lactation,
and so on.
Writing the body, as Cixous puts it, is woman's way of overcoming the
shame women have historically been made to feel with regard to their
bodies, exemplified---she says---by the various stupid modesties they
are expected to adhere to. Liberation is attained by attending to all
the nonverbal, unconscious, and instinctual
[[affect]] and sensations
produced by the body and finding the means of expressing them. Men are
not intrinsically excluded from this process: Cixous allows that writers
such as Shakespeare and Kleist are able to attain a kind of becoming
woman in their writing by virtue of their willingness to push language
to its limits of expressivity and invent news ways of thinking and
saying. As recent commentators have pointed out, Cixous's emphasis on
the body runs the risk of being essentialist (and thus excluding
[[transsexual]] women, among
others), but avoids that trap by emphasizing the experimental dimension.
Moreover Cixous's point is not that only women can write but that only
feminine writing---which can be written by both men and women---is
really writing. In this sense the focus on the body is not so much an
essential or essentialist step as a strategy for achieving the goal of
*écriture féminine*.
One can see in Cixous's creative works, particularly her plays, an
attempt to produce examples of *écriture féminine*. Her works often
contain highly sophisticated and therefore virtually untranslatable
wordplay as well as improvisational punctuation, textual spacing, and so
on. Her friend [[Derrida, Jacques]] aptly described
her as a 'poet-thinker', meaning both that she is a poet and a thinker
and that her thinking and poetry are inseparable. She repaid the
compliment by writing a book about Derrida entitled *Portrait de Jacques
Derrida en jeune saint juif* (2001), translated as *Portrait of Jacques
Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint* (2004). It is undoubtedly *La Jeune
née* (1975), translated as *The Newly Born Woman* (1986), co-written
with Catherine Clément, which best exemplifies this generic ambivalence
in which poetry and philosophy cease to be different from one another.
Probably her most famous and widely known play is *Portrait de Dora*
(1976), translated as *Portrait of Dora* (1983), which explores [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s famous case study
from the perspective of the patient. Cixous frequently collaborates with
Ariane Mnouchkine's improvisational Théâtre du Soleil. Her 1969 novel
*Dedans* (*Inside*) won the Prix Médicis.
