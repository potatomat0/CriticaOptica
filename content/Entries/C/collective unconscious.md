[[collective unconscious]]

 The
inherited dimension of the
[[psyche]] according to the
analytical psychology of [[Jung, Carl]]. Consisting of the
entirety of human history and manifesting itself in the form of a system
of [[archetype]], the
collective unconscious is what every human being has in common according
to Jung. So although it is a very general idea, it also has quite
specific manifestations, which can be seen instantiated in myths,
symbols, and rituals. Within the psyche itself, the collective
unconscious can be thought of as the most primitive dimension. The
collective unconscious is mediated by the personal unconscious in the
formation of the unified self.
