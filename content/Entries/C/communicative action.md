[[communicative action]]

 The
primary human activity, according to [[Habermas, JÃ¼rgen]], who argues that
philosophy should be focused on language and its capacities rather than
consciousness (the focus of much of continental philosophy prior to
Habermas, e.g. [[genre]] and
[[actant]]). Habermas's
assumption is that language was at its origin communicative, that its
purpose was to relay information and convey instructions. That is to
say, at its origin language was transactional, its purpose was to
achieve socially necessary goals. Communicative action is an extension
of [[pragmatics]] beyond the
realm of one-on-one interaction to the level of the social.
