[[Cultural Materialism]]

 Welsh
Marxist literary critic [[Williams, Raymond]] used this term in
the 1960s to describe how his own work combined criticism of specific
cultural texts with the material facts of history. In the 1980s, it was
widely taken up as the name for any kind of literary or cultural
research concerned with the relation between history and text. The main
names we associate with this particular trend are Catherine Belsey,
Jonathon Dollimore, and Alan Sinfield. Often, especially in relation to
[[Cultural Studies]], the
name Cultural Materialism was invoked polemically to distinguish those
forms of criticism which pertain to the 'real' world as opposed to those
which deal only with the 'inside' of texts, never connecting them to the
'outside' world (such as [[New Criticism]], [[Practical Criticism]], and according to
some lights Cultural Studies). It is often compared with [[New Historicism]], in large part
because the latter's key figure [[Greenblatt, Stephen]] studied with
Williams, but their approaches to the relationship between history and
text are quite different. Cultural Materialism treats
[[culture]] as a 'whole way
of life' (to use Williams's famous phrase), and not just as a series of
high points along the lines of Matthew Arnold, who regarded culture as
the 'best' that has been thought and written. If culture is a whole way
of life, then virtually anything can and must be treated as cultural: in
this way, Williams helped to create Cultural Studies, as the field of
research dedicated to interrogating all forms of cultural production. In
classical [[Marxism]],
culture is merely the expression of the economic base, but Williams
argued against this by problematizing the assumption that the relation
between the two is direct, allowing that a work may simultaneously
reflect and contest the established order determining it. Downplaying
economic and technological determinism, Williams shifted the emphasis to
social relations, arguing that texts can only be fully understood in
relation to [[Gramsci, Antonio]]'s concept of
[[hegemony]]. In other words,
the essential question for cultural material with respect to any text
is: does it challenge, alter, reject, or endorse the prevailing
ideology?
