[[constellation]] 

[[Benjamin, Walter]]  famously proposed
in the 'Epistemo-Critical Prologue' to *Ursprung des deutschen
Trauerspiels* (1928), translated as *The Origin of German Tragic Drama*
(1977), that ideas are to objects as constellations are to stars. That
is to say, ideas are no more present in the world than constellations
actually exist in the heavens, but like constellations they enable us to
perceive relations between objects. It also means ideas are not the same
as concepts, nor can they be construed as the laws of concepts. Ideas do
not give rise to knowledge about phenomena and phenomena cannot be used
to measure their validity. This is not to say the constellation is
purely subjective or all in our heads. The stars in the night sky are
where they are regardless of how we look at them and there is something
in how they are positioned above us that suggests the image we construct
of them. But having said that, the names we use for constellations are
embedded in history, tradition and myth. So the constellation is
simultaneously subjective and objective in nature. It is not, however, a
system, and this is its true significance for Benjamin, who rejects the
notion that philosophy can be thought of as systemic, as though it were
mathematical or scientific instead of discursive. Benjamin developed
this notion further in his account of the arcades in nineteenth-century
Paris. [[Adorno, Theodor]]
adopts and adapts constellation in his account of [[negative dialectics]], transforming it
into a model. The notion of constellation allows for a depiction of the
relation between ideas that gives individual ideas their autonomy but
does not thereby plunge them into a state of isolated
[[anomie]].

Persistence of the Dialectic* (1990).
