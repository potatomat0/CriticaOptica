[[cataphora]]

 A means of
linking two or more phrases, sentences, or ideas, by depriving the
reader of information in the first instance, thereby compelling the
reader to continue forward. In the example, 'It was beautiful, that
rainbow', 'It' functions cataphorically, pointing us towards the
rainbow. Contrast this with: 'The rainbow was beautiful'. *See also*
[[anaphora]].
