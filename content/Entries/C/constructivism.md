[[constructivism]]

 **1.**
Artistic movement originating in post-revolutionary Russia, at the start
of the 1920s. Active until the mid 1930s, when it was replaced by
[[socialist realism]],
constructivism was typified by its rejection of the romantic idea of art
for art's sake, and instead insisted that art should serve a social and
political purpose. Confined largely to the visual arts, (composer Dmitri
Shostakouich was briefly a constructionist, though this is not how he is
generally regarded) constructivism's best remembered works tend to be
posters produced in support of the revolution. Its influence was felt
most keenly in Weimar Germany, where similar revolutionary sentiments
were prevalent until the Nazis took power. The principal constructivist
artists were El Lissitzky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vladimir Tatlin, and
film-maker Dziga Vertov.
**2.** In philosophy, the position that reality is independent of human
perception and any knowledge that we have of it is necessarily a
construction. This is not the same thing as
[[relativism]], however,
because it does not question the existence of reality or our ability to
know that reality actually exists.
