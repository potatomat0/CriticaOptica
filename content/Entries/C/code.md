[[code]]

 **1.** In a famous and
highly influential essay 'The Television Discourse---Encoding and
Decoding' (1974) [[Hall, Stuart]] used the notion of
coding to map the different and potentially oppositional ways in which
TV producers and consumers make and receive texts. Television producers
may encode a text one way only to find that the audience decodes it in a
completely different way (decoding in this sense is equivalent to
[[Bloom, Harold]]'s notion of
creative misreading). Studies of fan culture, particularly the so-called
slash versions of texts created by fans---that is, texts which
appropriate characters from a popular show like *Star Trek* and write
new stories in which they are made gay or bisexual---bear this out. Hall
was particularly interested in trying to discern the ways in which the
[[hegemony]] viewpoint is
embedded in texts in a natural-seeming fashion.
**2.** In his late work *S/Z* (1970), translated as *S/Z* (1974),
[[Barthes, Roland]] attempted
to classify all the different types of signifieds (*see*
[[sign]]) to be found in a
literary text according to five codes: the *hermeneutic* code (the
posing of an enigma or riddle---the standard forms are: What has
happened? What is going to happen?); the *semic* code (the multiple
meanings or [[connotation]]
specific words, phrases, and scenes may contain); the *symbolic* code
(reversibility and transformation, the logic of dreams, fantasies, and
the body); the *proairetic* code (code of action sequences, genres and
tropes); and lastly the *cultural* code (the sum of tacit knowledge
required to interpret a particular text, e.g., the stereotypes, proverbs
and such like by which a culture gives itself particularity). The five
codes are not mutually exclusive and it is possible (indeed almost
impossible for it to be otherwise) for two or more codes to be present
in the one place at the one time.
**3.** [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[Guattari, FÃ©lix]] deploy the
notion of coding in *L'Anti-Oedipe* (1972), translated as *Anti-Oedipus*
(1977), to analyse the way
[[desire]] is captured and
channelled by social institutions. Coding subordinates the individual to
the collective. It takes both an actual and virtual form---tribal
tattoos, scarification, and so forth which renders group identity
visible, but also collective belief in higher powers such as totems, and
gods. They specify three separate processes: coding (the installation
and policing of belief), decoding (separation from specific codes,
either by means desacralization or secularization---it does not mean
interpretation, as in Hall's use of the term), and overcoding (the
super-inscription of new codes over old---for example, the celebration
of Easter incorporates both Christian and Pagan elements).
