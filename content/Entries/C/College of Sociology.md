[[College of Sociology]]
**(*Collège de Sociologie*)** An informal group of intellectuals which,
like the [[Vienna Circle]],
was founded with the purpose of sharing ideas and with the aim of
changing research in the humanities. It was founded in Paris in 1937 by
three exiles from
[[Surrealism]], [[Bataille, Georges]], Michel Leiris,
and Roger Caillois---other participants include [[Klossowski, Pierre]], [[Kojève, Alexandre]], Jean Paulhan, and
Jean Wahl. The group met fortnightly to discuss a wide range of
subjects, but with a common purpose of trying to discern the fundamental
nature of human society. They paid particular attention to indigenous
cultures, which they regarded as windows into the prehistory of western
society. They were fascinated by and wanted to explain the existence and
experience of the sacred and its complement, the festival. The College
was disbanded in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II.
