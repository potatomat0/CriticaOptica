[[Cultural Studies]]

 An
interdisciplinary approach to the study and analysis of
[[culture]] understood very
broadly to include not only specific texts, but also
[[practices]], and indeed
ways of life. The most influential works in the field have tended to be
large edited collections like Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, and Paula
Treichler's mammoth *Cultural Studies* (1991) and introductory textbooks
like John Fiske's *Reading the Popular* (1989), which reflects not only
the heterogeneous nature of work calling itself Cultural Studies, but
the fact that in a very real sense Cultural Studies is theoretically
provisional and avant-garde (its practitioners tend to be avid consumers
of new concepts drawn from a wide variety of fields).
Cultural Studies began in Britain in the late 1950s. [[Hoggart, Richard]]'s *The Uses of
Literacy* (1957) is often held up as the inaugural text, with [[Williams, Raymond]]'s *Culture and
Society: 1780--1950* (1958) running a close second. Both these authors
rejected the Leavisite model of [[Practical Criticism]], which was largely
concerned with identifying works suitable for inclusion in a highly
select canon of 'great works', in favour of a more expansive view of
[[culture]]. As
[[Marxism]] they were both
concerned to point up the importance of traditional and working class
culture and to show how changes in society threatened their very
existence. In contrast to practical criticism, Cultural Studies employed
history and sociology as well as 'close reading' in its analysis of
cultural texts. Cultural Studies achieved institutional status in 1964
when Hoggart founded the Birmingham
Centre for
Contemporary Cultural Studies
([[ISA]]).
For the next decade or so the CCCS provided much of the focus for the
developing field and many of the most famous names in the field were
based in Birmingham at this time. [[Hall, Stuart]] succeeded Hoggart as
director and (arguably) gave Cultural Studies the shape it has today by
importing the then quite new and radical thinking coming out of France
known as [[theory]], e.g.
[[structuralism]]
[[semiotics]], and (later)
[[post-structuralism]] and
theories of power as well. Britain fell into steep economic decline
during the 1970s, falling so far as to require an IMF loan to staunch
its currency, which of course had widespread social repercussions.
Cultural Studies was at its peak documenting this, but when Thatcher
came to power in 1979 it found it impossible to account for the profound
swing to the right that followed. Stuart Hall's magnificent *Hard Road
to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left* (1988) is the last
will and testament of this species of left-sympathetic (when not
avowedly Marxist) Cultural Studies.
In the 1980s Cultural Studies spread its wings and its focal point
shifted to Australia, not least because many of its pioneering
practitioners like Tony Bennett, John Fiske, and John Hartley migrated
there. Cultural Studies flourished in Australia, becoming in two decades
the dominant discipline in the humanities, at least in part because of
its facility for adaptation to the demands of the so-called 'reform' of
the higher education sector in the 1980s and 1990s. This came at the
price of its radical roots, the previously crucial notions of dissidence
and resistance all but vanished from the vocabulary, but gave rise to a
discipline ready, willing, and able to work in partnership with
government. Cultural Studies moved from being a discipline largely
concerned with the critique of government policy (as the most explicit
manifestation of power) to one that wants to help write that policy. The
field's principal organ, the journal *Cultural Studies*, began life in
Australia as the *Australian Journal of Cultural Studies*.
Cultural Studies also took root in the US thanks to the efforts of
several American CCCS students (particularly Hazel Carby, Michael
Denning, and Lawrence Grossberg) who brought it back home with them like
an intellectual contagion. But in contrast to the situation in Australia
it did not achieve hegemony. Rather it tended to be swallowed up or
placed alongside the much bigger fields of area studies, race studies,
African-American studies, and American studies. The fate of Cultural
Studies elsewhere has been uneven---it is still resisted in most parts
of Europe, particularly France and Germany, but even there it has gained
a foothold. Reflecting its global spread, an international Cultural
Studies association was formed in Finland in the 1990s.
After more than 50 years of existence, Cultural Studies still does not
have a specific methodology or a discrete area of interest: its approach
tends to be needs-based, meaning that it applies theory according to the
case at hand; and there is literally nothing that falls outside of the
scope of Cultural Studies. And that for its detractors and supporters
alike is both its strength and its weakness.
