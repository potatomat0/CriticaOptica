[[Calvino, Italo]] 
(1923--85)


Italian journalist and writer. Calvino was born in Cuba, where his
parents both worked as scientists---his father researched in
agriculture, while his mother was a botanist. When he was 2 his family
returned to Italy, settling in San Remo on a small rural property.
Calvino dutifully took courses in agriculture at the Universities of
Turin and Florence, but war interrupted his studies. He refused
compulsory military service and instead went into hiding and joined the
Italian Resistance, an act for which his parents (who supported his
decision) were imprisoned for the duration of the war. After the war he
returned to university, but abandoned agriculture and studied arts
instead. After graduation, he worked in publishing and journalism. He
was an active and committed member of the Communist Party, but like many
European intellectuals he resigned his membership following the Soviet
invasion of Hungary in 1956. He moved to Paris in 1967, where he met
Raymond Queneau (who encouraged him to join
[[OULIPO]]), [[Barthes, Roland]], and [[LÃ©vi-Strauss, Claude]]. Calvino
wrote a wide variety of fiction and non-fiction, and though some of his
early work is realist in style, it is his later more experimental work,
variously labelled
[[postmodern]], [[magical realism]], and
[[metafiction]], that
earned him his huge international following. His most widely read work
is *Se una notte d'inverno un viaggatore* (1979), translated as *If on
Winter's Night a Traveller* (1981).
