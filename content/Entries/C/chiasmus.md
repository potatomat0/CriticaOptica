[[chiasmus]]

 A figure of speech
in [[rhetoric]] composed of
two parallel clauses, the second of which reverses the first, e.g. 'when
the going gets weird, the weird turn pro' (Hunter S. Thompson). The term
derives from the Greek meaning to shape like a cross and its form was
considered significant to early Christian authors who used it to signify
the crucifixion of Christ.
