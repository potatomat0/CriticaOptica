[[critical theory]]

 **1.** The
term coined by [[Horkheimer, Max]] in 1937 to
describe the work of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Defined against the
traditional conception of theory governing the sciences (including the
social or human sciences such as sociology), which holds that it is a
system of abstract (i.e. ahistorical, asubjective, and asocial)
propositions which can be verified empirically, critical theory holds
the opposite view, namely that theory is historical, subjective, and a
part of society. Critical theory is in this regard a highly reflexive
enterprise---it is never satisfied with asking what something means or
how it works, it also has to ask what is at stake in asking such
questions in the first place.
Indeed, critical theory takes self-reflexivity a step further and asks
whether or not its objects of research are not artefacts of the theory.
Recent work by critical theorists like [[Haraway, Donna]], who writes about
the relationship between humans and animals, has shown the degree to
which this concern is justified. For critical theorists, the idea that
it is possible to derive 'mind-independent' concepts, that is, concepts
that do not involve the subjectivity of the theorist in some way in
either their conception or application, is both illusory and
[[glocalization]]. The attempt
to separate concepts from their producers, gives rise to what Horkheimer
scathingly referred to as [[instrumental reason]]. Thus critical theory
is ultimately concerned with what it is possible to know, given that the
ontological status of neither the subject nor the object of theory can
be taken for granted.
The word 'critical' should thus be understood to mean, as it does in
[[Kant, Immanuel]]'s work, the
opposite of 'analytical': it refers to the set of concepts whose reach
is always and of necessity greater than their grasp. For example, we can
neither see, hold, nor properly think something as vast as the universe,
in its totality, yet without the concept of the universe we would be
unable to situate ourselves in time and space. The same can be said of
concepts like nation,
[[society]],
[[community]], politics, and
so on, all of which are necessary for thinking about the state of the
world, even though none are verifiable in a strictly scientific sense.
In general, critical theory explores the connections, overlaps,
intersections, and interferences between the three spheres of economic
development, psychic life, and
[[culture]]. Its starting
premise, derived in part from [[Marx, Karl]], but also inspired by
[[Durkheim, Émile]] and Max
Weber, is that midway through the nineteenth century the world as a
whole underwent a major transformation and entered a new period of
history known as
[[modernity]]. This entails
three consequences: tradition cannot be used as a guide for thinking
about either the present or the future; society has splintered into
semi-autonomous sub-systems (e.g. the market, the various professions,
industry), making it difficult but necessary to find ways of speaking of
'the whole'; the good, the true, and the beautiful have been
disaggregated, presenting new challenges to ethics, philosophy and
aesthetics.
Under such conditions, critical theory is interested in why human
society has (in its eyes) failed to live up to the promise of
enlightenment and become what it is today, unequal, unjust, and largely
uncaring. Witnesses to the barbarity of both the First and Second World
Wars, the first generation of critical theorists can perhaps be forgiven
for the bleakness of their outlook.
**2.** Today the term is also used to refer---very loosely, it has to be
said---to any form of theorizing in the humanities and social sciences,
even when this isn't politically consistent with the outlook of the
original Frankfurt School. This has tended to empty the term of any
meaning and rendered both its political and methodological concerns
invisible.
