[[class]]

 A social category
that on the one hand acknowledges a shared state of affairs amongst a
large group of people whose material conditions are very similar and on
the other hand recognizes that significant and real differences do exist
between groups. From the perspective of their material conditions (i.e.
how much money they have at their disposal, the kinds of houses they can
afford, and so on), the group of people who are either unemployed or
underemployed have more in common with each other than they do with
professional people, who are better paid and have greater financial
security. Therefore the unemployed or underemployed constitute one class
and the professionals constitute another class. This concept is central
to [[Marxism]], although
[[Marx, Karl]] himself did not
invent the term, nor did he ever provide a satisfactorily complete
definition. On Marx's understanding, class is an essentially
antagonistic concept: it defines not merely lines of difference, but
lines of struggle. The history of class, Marx famously said, is the
history of [[class struggle]]. Class is not
simply a matter of the passive membership of a group. Marx assumes that
classes arise out of a sense of common interest born of a common
situation and a common idea of who the enemy is, or what he terms
[[class consciousness]]. When
it is said, as it sometimes is (especially by the right wing), that
class no longer exists and that we live in a classless society, it is in
fact class consciousness that is at issue, not class itself, which as an
economic category is manifestly still with us. In this respect, it is
crucial to note that Marx connected class to his concept of the [[mode of production]], arguing that
classes are defined according to the relationship to the means of
production. Do they own the means of production or not? That is the
essential question for Marx, who using that metric identified three
basic classes: the proletariat (wage earners who have nothing but their
labour to sell), bourgeoisie (the owners of the means of production, or
capitalists), and land-owners (rentiers). Viewed in this strict fashion,
the professional class (inasmuch as they do not own factories, but
receive wages) are closer to the unemployed or underemployed than they
are to bourgeoisie, even though they may share the latter's cultural
tastes and habits. This is a problem [[Bourdieu, Pierre]] addresses in his
concept of [[habitus]]. As
Marx conceived it, class crosses all geographical boundaries---the
proletariat are the same whether they are based in America or Asia---and
it was always his hope that the workers of the world would recognize
their common situation and unite and together overthrow the capitalist
class. A similar vision animates [[Hardt, Michael]] and [[Negri, Antonio]]'s concept of
[[multitude]].
