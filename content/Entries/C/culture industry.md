[[culture industry]] 

[[Horkheimer, Max]] and [[Adorno, Theodor]] 's term for the
commercialization of art in all its forms---music, literature, the
visual arts---and its subsequent permeation of every aspect of daily
life that occurred in the first part of the twentieth century. Written
in exile in Los Angeles in the 1940s, Horkheimer and Adorno's essay 'The
Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception' is a central plank in
their account of the transformation of life in
[[modernity]] offered in
*Dialektik der Aufkl√§rung* (1944), translated as *Dialectic of
Enlightenment* (1972).
The choice of terms---culture industry rather than 'mass culture' (their
original choice) or 'popular culture'---provides a significant clue as
to how this concept should be understood: the emphasis should be placed
on the second word not the first. For what Horkheimer and Adorno were
struck by in their analyses of Hollywood was the fact that the
application of industrial processes of production, distribution, and
consumption to culture resulted in the complete deterioration of culture
as they knew it. In effect, their implication is: where there is
industry there cannot be culture. This is because, as [[Marcuse, Herbert]] would later
explain, under such conditions culture is performed rather than lived.
The culture industry's singular aim is to produce a form of culture
compatible with the aims of capitalism. In order to make culture into
the means of reliably turning a profit it has to be standardized and its
disruptive power neutralized. Standardization primarily occurs at the
level of form, a fact that is masked by the apparent variety of what
Horkheimer and Adorno scathingly refer to as psuedo-individualization of
content. For example, as several formalist studies of genre fiction
(particularly crime, romance, and westerns) have shown, difference tends
to be confined to the incidentals of setting and character and even then
there are restrictions. Because of its commitment to market principles,
the culture industry tends to try to repeat success via duplication and
avoid failure by minimizing innovation. This doesn't mean it cannot make
entertaining, complex, and interesting products, but it does mean at the
end of the day all it makes is products.
Consequently, as Jameson explains in *Late Marxism* (1990), [[critical theory]] regards the offerings
of the culture industry as inauthentic (meaning false or deceitful in
both an ontological and ideological sense) because like all commodities
they proclaim that happiness and pleasure already exists and is readily
available for consumption. Authentic art, by contrast, offers no such
consolation and instead affirms the sheer negativity of existence. The
culture industry reverses [[Kant, Immanuel]]'s famous dictum that
art is 'purposiveness without purpose' and gives rise to
'purposelessness for purpose', or what Marcuse referred to as
[[desublimation]].
Lastly, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the culture industry is not
the same thing as the creative industry, although from a certain
perspective one could rightly say their referent is the same. Creative
industry is a techno-bureaucratic term whose precise ideological purpose
is to erase the negativity implicit in Horkheimer and Adorno's coinage,
and as such is a clear-cut example of what they themselves would have
called [[instrumental reason]]. The culture industry
thesis has been criticized by Anglo-American [[Cultural Studies]] for failing to
perceive the power of consumers to consume cultural products in their
own highly individualized manner.
