[[Castoriadis, Cornelius]]
(1922--97) Paris-based Greek political philosopher and psychoanalyst.
Born in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) and educated in Greece,
Castoriadis lived in France from the end of the Second World War until
his death. At 15 he joined the Kommounistike Neolaia (Communist Youth)
in Athens and in 1941 he joined the Communist Party, but left after only
a year to become a Trotskyist. His association with communist groups
caused him considerable trouble during the Nazi occupation of Greece.
When he moved to Paris he joined the Trotskyist Parti Communiste
Internationaliste, but cancelled his membership after three years in
response to Tito's break with Stalin in 1948 and helped to establish the
breakaway group (which included [[Debord, Guy]], Claude Lefort, and
[[Lyotard, Jean-François]])
who have come to be known by the name of the journal they founded,
*Socialisme ou Barbarie* (Socialism or Barbarism).
The [*Socialism or
Barbarism](#X1670dd80dcb53ba1c1cf0a08a6292f3fb4a4852) group was always
very small, but its journal provided an important outlet for
Castoriadis. He did not obtain an academic job until very late in life
and for most of his professional career he was employed as an economist
by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development
([[COBRA]]). Neither did he have
French citizenship until 1970, which meant he could have been deported
back to Greece at virtually any time. Consequently most of his early
writings were written under a variety of pseudonyms (Paul Chardan and
Pierre Chalieu were the most commonly used).
His work as an economist influenced his view of Marxism. Although a
committed Marxist, Castoriadis was an anti-Soviet. He saw the USSR as a
bureaucratic state rather than a communist country and was highly
critical of its centralized power structure. He came to reject Marxist
economic theories and focused more on the idea of revolution, stressing
that it was the spirit not the doctrine of Marx that was important.
Although an activist throughout the 1960s, he also started to move in
this period towards a more psychoanalytic view of the world as he tried
to understand the relationship between individuals and social
formations.
He trained as a psychoanalyst (though not with [[Lacan, Jacques]] or his [[École Freudienne de Paris]]) and obtained a
licence to practise in 1974. His most well-known publications date from
this period, such as *L'institution imaginaire de la société* (1975),
translated as *The Imaginary Institution of Society* (1987), in which
Castoriadis set out to articulate his theory of the autonomous subject.
For Castoriadis the subject is not completely self-producing; he or she
must constitute themselves using the pre-existing resources of society.
So revolutionary change can come only insofar as it is possible to
increase one's autonomy in relation to these resources of the psyche.
This was consistent with his earlier political writings that insisted
neither capital nor the state could be entrusted with the control of
society and that the only hope for socialism lay in the autonomy of the
workers.
Castoriadis was a prolific writer until his untimely death. His writings
have largely been translated into English. For an excellent cross
section of his work see the three-volume work *Political and Social
Writings* (1988--93).
