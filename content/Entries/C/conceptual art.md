[[conceptual art]]

 A
non-representational form of art which sees its purpose as the creation
of ideas. The artistic object, as such, is not then the finished work,
but the idea it provokes in its audience. It does not concern itself,
therefore, with the need for physical permanency; indeed, very often a
photograph of the event is the only record of its existence. Noted
conceptual artists include: Joseph Beuys, Claus Oldenburg, and Joseph
Kosuth.
