[[class struggle]]

 The inherent
antagonism of [[class]],
according to [[Marx, Karl]],
who famously said that the history of class is the history of class
struggle. If, as Marx argues, class is both a condition of existence and
an awareness of a common situation amongst a
[[multitude]] (which Marx
referred to as [[class consciousness]]), then he
reasoned it was to be expected that that awareness would provoke the
desire for change, by revolutionary means if necessary. His reasoning is
that awareness of class is implicitly awareness of the fact that
different classes have different, even contradictory interests, and that
cannot but result in conflict. The owners of the means of production
(the bourgeoisie) have an interest in driving down wages as low as they
can so as to maximize profit, a fact that conflicts with the interest of
wage labourers (the proletariat), who would obviously prefer to see
wages increase as much as possible. The interest of one thus contradicts
the interest of the other, the result of which is conflict. Marx saw
this conflict taking a number of different forms: cultural, economic,
political, and finally revolutionary overthrow. But this struggle could
only succeed if it became general, if all the workers united together in
a common cause.
