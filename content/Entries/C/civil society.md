[[civil society]]

 The private
or non-governmental dimension of the organization or administration of
the state. It is generally contrasted with political society, which is
the coercive, governmental dimension of the state. But the separation of
civil and political society is artificial. As
[[Marxism]] political
theorist [[Gramsci, Antonio]]
argues, the reality is that the state is a dual system comprising both a
coercive and consensual apparatus. Standard elements of civil society
include trade unions, workers cooperatives, and mutual aid societies.
The concept has a long and varied history and there is an immense
literature on the subject which is divided on two key issues: what
exactly comprises civil society (i.e. where to draw the line between
those institutions that do and do not form part of it), and what is it
capable of (i.e. is it really a forum for progressive, non-violent
change?).
