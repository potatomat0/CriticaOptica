[[collocation]]

 Words that are
regularly used together in vernacular speech, such as 'clean and tidy',
or 'neat as a pin'. Interrupting the regular pairing of words is an
important, albeit easy way of achieving poetic
[[ressentiment]]---for
example, instead of saying 'I'm afraid I cannot do that', one might also
write, 'I'm scared that I cannot do that'. The collocation in the second
case is completely wrong and is typical of the kind of error a
non-native speaker might make. The point is that there is no logical
reason why one should say 'afraid' rather than 'scared' in this context,
but the habit of national speech dictates that the former is right and
the latter is wrong.
