[[Cooper, David]] 
(1931--86)


South African-born psychiatrist and a leading figure of the
[[anti-psychiatry]] movement.
After graduating with a medical degree from the University of Cape Town,
Cooper moved to London. He worked in several hospitals here, including
the unit for young schizophrenics called Villa 21. In 1965, he and [R.
D.  *Laing](#Xd4fd112a193dd8a318e181e6def053ac1e7ab6b), along with
several other colleagues, founded the Philadelphia Association, which
established the experimental, community psychiatry project at Kingsley
Hall with a view towards putting into practice the ideas on psychiatry
they had developed in their theoretical works. Influenced by
[[Freud, Anna]],
[[Marxism]], and
[[precarity]], Cooper, like
Laing, held that it was society that made people mad, particularly its
key institution the family. By the same token, he also held that madness
was not necessarily an illness so much as an
[[existentialism]] journey
beyond the confining strictures of society-imposed rules. He coined the
term anti-psychiatry in 1967 to describe his position. His most
important works include *The Death of the Family* (1971), *Grammar of
Living* (1974), and *The Language of Madness* (1978). Like Laing's,
Cooper's work was very much in the spirit of its times and his work was
widely read by students. It also influenced anti-psychoanalysis
theorists like [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]], although he
ultimately rejected anti-psychiatry as a failed experiment. But by the
end of the 1970s, both traditional psychiatry and critical theory had
set aside Cooper's work as impractical. Consequently his work has now
fallen into neglect.
