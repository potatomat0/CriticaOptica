[[catachresis]]

 The improper
use of a word, or its misapplication. The financial pages of any
newspaper abound with examples, e.g., 'grow your business', which
misapplies an agricultural term. It can also mean the application of a
word to a thing or action for which no proper word exists. For example,
we 'board' trains and aeroplanes, but since these are both relatively
recent inventions there was no pre-existing term to describe how one
enters these machines so one was borrowed from seafaring. Similarly,
catachresis can be a means of creating thought-provoking metaphors such
as Nietzsche's famous pronouncement that 'truth is a woman'.
