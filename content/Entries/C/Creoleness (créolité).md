[[Creoleness]] (créolité)


Literary and cultural theory elaborated in the 1980s by a small group of
Francophone authors from the Caribbean, particularly Martinique and
Guadeloupe, the most prominent of whom are Patrick Chamoiseau, Jean
Bernabé (1942--2017), and Raphaël Confiant. Its main theorist is
[[Glissant, Édouard]], who
joined the group later, and acknowledges the influence of [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]]. Creoleness was
established in opposition to
[[négritude]], a literary
movement established in the 1930s by the (also Francophone) Caribbean
and African writers [[Césaire, Aimé]], [[Senghor, Léopold]], and Léon Damas.
These authors sought to define themselves in terms of their links to the
African continent, seeing their shared heritage as part of the black
[[diaspora]] as a source of
empowerment for colonial peoples. In contrast, the Creoleness writers
reject this stance as backward looking, but also unfeasible inasmuch
that Caribbean peoples and Africans are too unlike to ever be fully
integrated, preferring instead to look forward to a post-essentialist
future. Ultimately Creoleness is a celebration of diversity and a
negation of what it sees as false universality.
