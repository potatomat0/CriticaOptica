[[cynical reason]]

 **(zynische
Vernunft)** German philosopher [[Sloterdijk, Peter]]'s term for what
he calls enlightened [[false consciousness]]. In his
unexpectedly bestselling book, *Kritik der zynischen Vernunft* (1983),
translated as *The Critique of Cynical Reason* (1987), Sloterdijk
describes cynical reason as the end of the ideal, central to both the
[[Enlightenment]] and
[[Marxism]], that an increase
in our understanding of the true nature of the world will necessarily
bring about social change. [[Žižek, Slavoj]] defines cynical
reason as the feeling that we know very well that our present situation
is invidious, but all the same we act as though it isn't. Global
inaction, relatively speaking, in the face of knowledge about climate
change is a perfect case in point. Even though we tell ourselves we know
we are heading for a planet-wide disaster, we act as though nothing is
wrong. *See also* [instrumental
