[[contradiction]]

 The
combination of two logically incompatible propositions. A contradiction
arises when one statement negates the other as in Beckett's wonderful
phrase (quoted by [[Foucault, Michel]] in his inaugural
lecture at the Coll√®ge de France), 'I can't go on. I'll go on.' If one
literally cannot go on, then obviously one cannot go on, so to put these
two phrases together is a contradiction. This is also what gives it its
poetic power. In [[Marx, Karl]]'s view contradiction
is the motor of history---in his theory, the relationship between the
owners of the means of production (i.e. the bourgeoisie) and the
proletariat is contradictory because their interests do not coincide: it
is not in the interest of the bourgeoisie to pay high wages because it
reduces profits and it is not in the interest of the workers to accept
low wages. This is the basic form of what Marx called [[class struggle]]. Marx always
thought that this contradiction would become so acute in real terms that
it would lead to an upsurge of revolutionary unrest such that the
workers would topple the bourgeoisie and bring an end to capitalism.
History, to date, suggests he was wrong about this. Consequently, there
has arisen a branch of Marxist thinking known as post-Marxism which
tries to rethink history minus contradiction.
