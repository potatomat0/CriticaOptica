[[compulsion to repeat]]
**(*Wiederholungszwang*)** A highly complex concept in
[[psychoanalysis]] with at
least two orders of meaning: firstly, in the weakest sense, it refers to
the myriad rituals and routines many people seem to adhere to in their
[[everyday life]] which, if
interrupted, would cause mild to severe discomfort; secondly, in the
strongest sense, it refers to the persistence of unconscious thoughts
and their ability to evade even the most determined forms of
[[repression]]. Aptly,
[[Žižek, Slavoj]] often uses
the image of the zombie in cinema to characterize the compulsion to
repeat---the image is apt because as a compulsion it lies outside of the
control of conscious thought and because in Freud's view the compulsion
to repeat belongs to the order of the [[death-drive]]. Freud treats the
compulsion to repeat as a symptom of a disturbed
[[unconscious]]---most likely
that disturbance is caused by a trauma the unconscious has not yet been
able to process, so it relives it over and over again until it can. The
much talked about 'pop psychological' notion of 'closure' is directed
precisely at this phenomenon: we desire closure so as to bring the
compulsion to repeat a traumatic memory to an end.
