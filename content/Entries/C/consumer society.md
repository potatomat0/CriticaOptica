[[consumer society]] 

(*la société de consummation*) 
A term adopted by French cultural critic
[[Baudrillard, Jean]] to
characterize a trend in society to treat consumption (i.e. the
purchasing of material goods) as a socially valuable activity in its own
right. His point is that in the post-World War II boom economy
consumption became decoupled from production; whereas previous economic
models focused on production as the only source of growth, in the 1950s
and 1960s economic modelling began to focus more on consumption. Perhaps
the most important sign of this was the new availability of relatively
easy to obtain cheap credit, enabling people to buy now what they could
only afford later. Consumer society also constitutes a change of
mindset, a shift away from the 'save then buy' mode of thinking to a
'buy now pay later' attitude. The result of this change of mindset was,
according to Baudrillard, a massive proliferation of objects whose
purpose was no longer justified by need, but instead catered solely to
want. *See also*
