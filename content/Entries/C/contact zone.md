[[contact zone]]

 Mary Louise
Pratt's term in *Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation*
(1992) for social places (understood geographically) and spaces
(understood ethnographically) where disparate cultures meet and try to
come to terms with each other. It is used quite widely in literary
studies and [[Cultural Studies]] as well as
[[Postcolonial Studies]] as a
general term for places where white western travellers have encountered
their cultural, ethnic, or racial other and been transformed by the
experience. Contact zones are most often trading posts or border cities,
cities where the movement of peoples and commodities brings about
contact. *See also*
