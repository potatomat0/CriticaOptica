[[COBRA]]

 Artistic movement
founded in 1948 by a group of artists from Denmark, Belgium, and the
Netherlands (the name itself is an acronym constructed from the names of
the principal cities of the respective countries: *Co*penhagen,
*Br*ussels and *A*msterdam) who had become disenchanted with
[[Surrealism]]. Unwilling to
obey [[Breton, André]]'s
anti-communist dictates, these artists, many of whom had participated in
the Resistance during World War II, decided to branch out on their own.
The key figures were Asger Jorn, Christian Dotrement, and Constant
Nieuwenhuys. The group's aim was to integrate Surrealist practices and
revolutionary politics in order to make art that was experimental,
festive, and vital. More broadly, they wanted to displace Paris as the
art capital, get away from the orthodoxy of Breton's Surrealism, and
move on from abstract and non-figurative art. They did not manage to
displace Paris as the capital of the art world, but COBRA did have a
lasting influence on twentieth-century art. The group was, however, very
short-lived: it was dissolved in 1951 after the core members fell out
over the role and place of politics in art. Jorn would later team up
with [[Debord, Guy]] to help
establish [[Situationism]].
COBRA's signature style was a kind of creative disfigurement that was
close to Surrealism and Art Brut, but rejected the unconscious as overly
individualistic or subjectivistic. It sought a collective basis for art
and society and to this end emphasized totemic and mythic subjects.
