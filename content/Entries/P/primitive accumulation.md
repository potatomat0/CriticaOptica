[[primitive accumulation]]

 The
starting point of capitalist accumulation, which is not itself the
product of capitalist accumulation. As [[Marx, Karl]] argues in the first
volume of *Capital*, capitalist production presupposes a considerable
mass of capital---this capital, by definition, must have been put
together by non-capitalist means. Economists like Adam Smith referred to
this capital as 'previous capital', thus making the transition from one
economic mode to another seem both benign and beneficial, when the
reality was anything but. In Marx's view, this moment was marked by
violence, conquest, enslavement, and theft. The transition from
feudalism to capitalism followed the violent dispossession of a whole
class of people---primarily the peasants---from control of any means of
production, specifically land. The first and perhaps most important step
in primitive accumulation, according to Marx, was the enclosure of
common lands, which was enabled by the state.
