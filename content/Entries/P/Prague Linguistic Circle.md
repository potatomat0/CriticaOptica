[[Prague Linguistic Circle]]

 A
discussion group founded in 1926 by a small group of Czech and
expatriate Russian linguists, for the purpose of analysing the poetic
function of language. The group was chaired by renowned linguist [[Jakobson, Roman]], but also
numbered amongst its membership Nicolai Troubetzkoy and Jan Mukařovský.
Also known as the Prague School, the group survived World War II (though
many of its members were forced into exile) but not the rise to power of
the Communist Party. It was officially dissolved in 1950, but had in
reality already dissipated two years earlier. As a crucial precursor to
[[structuralism]], the group
worked through a number of ideas taken from
[[suture]], and created the
first effective form of a structuralist linguistics (characterized by a
pronounced interest in
[[langue]] rather than
*parole*). As with its predecessors,
[[Opoyaz]] and the
[[Moscow Linguistic Circle]],
from which its membership was in part drawn in any case, the group
sought to bring together
[[poetics]] and linguistics.
