[[palimpsest]]

 A manuscript
written on a piece of any material (paper, parchment, stone, vellum,
etc.) which has previously been written on, but whose surface has been
cleaned to make way for the new text. Common in the Middle Ages before
paper became widely available, today it is generally used as a
[[metaphor]] for a text with
more than one layer of meaning, an allegory for example.
