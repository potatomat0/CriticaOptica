[[post-structuralism]]

 An
influential movement (albeit one whose membership is ambiguous) in
[[critical theory]] that came
into being as the result of an internal critique of the movement that
preceded it, namely
[[structuralism]], with which
it shares a number of crucial characteristics, particularly the latter's
anti-humanist de-privileging of the individual conscious and the
subject. Its principal characteristic is scepticism (to the point of
irrationality according to its critics) towards any form of completeness
of either knowledge or understanding. It rejects all transcendental
and/or idealist ontologies and epistemologies and accepts only those
theories of being and knowledge that are premised on the final
unknowability of these things.
Post-structuralism is generally thought to have emerged at a conference
held at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 to celebrate the achievements
of structuralism and showcase it to American academics. A young scholar
by the name of [[Derrida, Jacques]] presented a paper
criticizing the conference's keynote speaker and one of the founding
fathers of structuralism, [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]], entitled 'La
structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines',
translated as 'Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of Human
Sciences' (1978). In what would become well known as his style of
thinking, Derrida shattered the illusion at the heart of structuralism,
namely that language could be frozen long enough to identify its
universal characteristics. But, Derrida argued, language is a continuous
process, and as such, its structures (i.e. its internal rules) are
subject to constant variation. What we recognize as post-structuralist
thinking today is the extension of this idea to virtually every aspect
of human thought, with the effect that it has become a doctrine that no
idea, concept, thought, or thing is ever fully what we think it is.
Derrida uses the word
[[différance]] to name this
state of affairs.
Post-structuralism is a very loosely applied term. It is often treated
as a synonym for
[[postmodernism]], but this
is misleading because whereas postmodernism concerns changes at the
level of the world-historical, post-structuralism refers only to an
intellectual position. Similarly, it is often used as a synonym for
deconstruction, but this is also imprecise because although Derrida is
credited with initiating this particular intellectual position, he has
his own project which does not coincide on all points with
post-structuralism as it is generally understood. Along the same lines,
it is often said to include authors as diverse as
[[utopia]],
[[hysteria]], Derrida,
[[Deleuze, Gilles]],
[[actual]],
[[anomie]], and Lyotard, but
this is also misleading inasmuch as it makes it seem that the work of
these authors has something more in common than the general agreement
that structuralism was inadequate in several important respects. In the
hands of its critics, like [[Habermas, Jürgen]], and [[Frank, Manfred]], post-structuralism
is simply a code word for irrational and irresponsible philosophy. Thus
it is a term that should be used with considerable caution.
