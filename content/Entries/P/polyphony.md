[[polyphony]]

 Russian linguist
and literary critic [[Bakhtin, Mikhail]] used this word,
literally meaning many voiced to describe literary writing that managed
to liberate the voice of its characters from under the domination of the
authorial or narratorial voice. In *Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics*
(1984), Bakhtin refers to polyphony as a new kind of artistic thinking
because what he has in mind goes against the grain of the traditional
privileging of harmony, which means many voices heard as one. The reader
of Dostoevsky, Bakhtin suggests, cannot but have the impression that he
or she isn't dealing with a single author, but is in fact faced with a
multiplicity of authors (Raskolnikov, Myshkin, Stavrogin, Ivan
Karamazov, the Grand Inquisitor, and so on), each of whom has their own
unique voice. *See also*
