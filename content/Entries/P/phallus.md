[[phallus]]

 The imaginary and
symbolic value of the penis. The phallus is not the same as the penis;
it is a representation, not a part of the male anatomy. In
[[psychoanalysis]],
particularly [[anaclisis]]
psychoanalysis (indeed it is not a distinction [[Freud, Sigmund]] himself ever makes),
it is at its most basic the representation of the male reproductive
organ as it appears in the unconscious of both the child and the adult.
The child passes successfully through the
[[field]] phase to the
degree that it recognizes that the phallus is a symbol and can therefore
never be possessed. The phallus is in this sense synonymous with
castration and it affects boys and girls equally. As such, it is also
the ultimate form of the signified (*see*
[[sign]]), the point where the
chain of signification comes to an end.
