[[phoneme]]

 A functional, i.e.
meaningful, unit of sound, as in the distinction between 'bat' and
'cat'---the 'b' and 'c' sounds change or determine the meaning of the
word as it would be heard in normal speech. By contrast, if one were to
spell the words as follows 'batt' and 'catt', thus emphasizing the 't'
sound, it would make no functional difference.
