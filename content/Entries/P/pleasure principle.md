[[pleasure principle]]
**(*Lustprinzip*)** According to
[[Freud, Anna]], all
actions---conscious and
[[unconscious]]---give rise
to [[pleasure]] or its
opposite unpleasure in the psychical apparatus. In the course of daily
life we try to regulate our thoughts and actions so that we have more of
the first and less of the second. It is for this reason known as an
'economic model' of the psychical apparatus, where pleasure is regarded
as an equivalent of money and unpleasure the equivalent of debt. It is
also known as a constancy principle or nirvana principle because it is
assumed that the subject's primary aim is to achieve a plateau which is
just pleasurable enough. While Freud certainly has sensual pleasures in
mind, pleasure does not necessarily have to take that form. The pleasure
in question may also be an
[[ego]] pleasure, i.e. the
pleasure the ego obtains from gaining the
[[superego]]'s approval. By
the same token, unpleasure takes the form of self-reproach, or more
usually a kind of negative tension one experiences when a pleasure is
delayed, i.e. it doesn't usually arise from having to do something one
might find distasteful.
