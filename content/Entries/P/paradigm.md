[[paradigm]]

 **1.** The
vertical axis of communication in
[[neurosis]] linguistics
and [[semiotics]]. The
horizontal axis or
[[syntagm]] defines the deep
structure of a particular piece of communication, with the vertical axis
specifying the possible lexical variations that structure can
meaningfully accommodate. So in the sentence 'the boy went to the shop',
we can substitute girl for boy, beach for shop and so on, all without
altering the 'a person went somewhere' relational structure of the
sentence.
**2.** American historian of science [[Kuhn, Thomas Samuel]] uses this term to
describe different moments in scientific development, coining the phrase
'paradigm shift' to name the ruptures that occur in thought when a new
discovery is made. The best known example of so-called 'paradigm shift'
is of course the Copernican revolution, namely the insight that the
earth is not the centre of the solar system.
