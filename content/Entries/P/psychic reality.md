[[psychic reality]]

 Everything
that strikes a person as being real, regardless of whether it is
actually real. Psychic reality feels real to the person who experiences
it and they have no sense that it might not be real. Swiss analytical
psychologist [[Jung, Carl]]
used this term to explain the fact that two people may encounter a
specific event quite differently. It also explains how one person may
apprehend quite different things---poltergeists and spiders, let's
say---in fundamentally the same way. In Jung's theory, psychic reality
is an intermediary phase between the physical world of sense data on the
one hand and the spiritual world of thought and cognition on the other
hand.
