[[practices]]

 A code word in
[[Cultural Studies]] for what
people do in the course of their [[everyday life]]. Such activities as
dating, shopping, walking, watching TV, and the like are generally
regarded as examples of practices. Although the term is somewhat out of
fashion nowadays, the twofold impetus behind its coinage remains
current: on the one hand, the term is used to defend the position that
there is no aspect of culture (no matter how banal) that is not
significant and therefore worthy of critical attention; on the other
hand, it is used as a tacit critique or indeed rejection of the central
plank of both psychology and
[[psychoanalysis]], namely
the assumption that it is possible to know *why* people do what they do.
In this regard, the uptake of the term could be said to signal an
empirical turn in Cultural Studies, the basic position of which is as
follows: we can know what people do because their activity can be
observed and recorded, but we cannot know why they do what they do
because their intentions and purposes are not visible. Behind this turn,
however, there is also a stubborn repudiation of
[[Marxism]]. For Marxism, the
reason why we do things can and must be explained in terms of
[[ideology]]. Practices
became prominent in Cultural Studies in large part because of [[Bourdieu, Pierre]] and [[Certeau, Michel de]], who both used the
term in comparable ways. Certeau's highly influential two-volume study
(produced in collaboration with Luce Giard and Pierre Mayol)
*L'invention du quotidian* (1980), translated as *The Practice of
Everyday Life* (1984), proposed the hypothesis that practices are the
texts of everyday life and that by using the resources of
[[semiotics]] they can be
made legible. He even went so far as to propose that it might be
possible to develop a grammar of such activities as walking and
introduced the concepts of [[symptomatic reading]] as possible analytic
terms. John Fiske popularized these ideas in several of his books,
particularly *Understanding Popular Culture* (1989), while John Frow
provided a comprehensive critique of them in *Cultural Studies and
Cultural Value* (1995). For Bourdieu, practices are a branch of reason
or 'savoir faire' ('know how') that stems from the body rather than
mind.
