[[philology]]

 A theory of
language development which traces the 'family tree' of modern natural
languages like English, French, and German back to their historical
origins. The central point of interest of such research is to show the
common ancestry of words dispersed across several languages. Although a
highly distinguished philologist himself, [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]] inaugurated the
[[semiotics]] revolution by
arguing against this account of the history of language.
