[[post-feminism]]

 The position,
variously argued, that
[[feminism]] (specifically
[[radical feminism]] or
so-called [[Second Wave feminism]]) is no longer
relevant in the present situation either because (in the affirmative
case) it has achieved its goals and has therefore reached its limit of
usefulness, or (in the negative case) it was wrongheaded to begin with
and has been superseded by a more sophisticated version. More of a sound
bite than a fully thought-out concept, it is a fundamentally
conservative notion, much like [[Fukuyama, Francis]]'s notion of the
'end of history', in that it wants to say both that the struggle for
equality of the sexes is over and that the struggle was unnecessarily
shrill and aggressive to begin with. However, as many feminist
commentators have pointed out, the post-feminist position does not
reflect the reality on the ground for the majority of women in the world
today, who continue to face gender bias in the workplace and at home.
