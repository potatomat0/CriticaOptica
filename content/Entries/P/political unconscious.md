[[political unconscious]]

 A
concept created by [[Jameson, Fredric]] to articulate the
implicit political dimension of creative works. First proposed in *The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act* (1981), the
political unconscious draws on and adapts
[[Freud, Anna]]'s notion of
[[wish-fulfilment]] and
[[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]]'s notion of
the savage mind ('*pensée sauvage*') to construct the hypothesis that
artistic works can be seen as symbolic solutions to real but
unconsciously felt social and cultural problems. The task of the
cultural critic is then to find the means of reconstructing the original
problem for which the text as symbolic act is a solution. This approach
to textual criticism turns not so much on the question of what does a
particular text mean as why it exists in the form that it does.
