[[poetics]]

 The study of the
formal construction of literary works of all genres, not just poetry. It
is underpinned by the assumption that it is possible to delineate what
it is that separates a poetic (literary) use of language from a
non-poetic (ordinary) use of language. In contrast to [[Russian Formalism]], which is an
obvious precursor, it is not primarily concerned with the problem of
determining which is literary and which is not; rather, its concern is
with the effectivity and unity of specific literary works. Poetics is
often treated as a synonym for
[[structuralism]] literary
theory.
