[[phenomenology]]

 A philosophy
of the intentional being of consciousness (*see*
[[intentionality]]), founded by
German philosopher [[Husserl, Edmund]] in the latter part
of the nineteenth century. Until the advent of
[[structuralism]] in the
1950s it was the dominant mode of philosophy in Europe: its most notable
adherents include Husserl's student [[Heidegger, Martin]] (they did not
see eye to eye---Husserl thought Heidegger had misunderstood
phenomenology, while Heidegger thought Husserl's version of it was
flawed), as well as [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]] and
[[Levinas, Emmanuel]]. The
object of phenomenology, namely intentionality, bears a superficial
resemblance to what is sometimes known as 'inner experience'. This is
because it is only available via reflection, i.e. after the fact.
Husserl's research countered this problem with two reductions: first, he
excluded all appeals to transcendent objects (i.e. objects whose meaning
is intrinsic) to ground cognition; second, he separated the incidental
instances of intentionality from the universal, which he termed eidetic.
Consciousness, Husserl famously insisted, is always consciousness of
something. Consciousness thus has two dimensions: (i) there is
consciousness directed at an object, which Husserl refers to as
[[noesis]], and (ii) the
object that consciousness is directed at, which Husserl refers to as
noema. These, in turn, vary according to modality and temporality.
Heidegger's critique of phenomenology centres on the priority Husserl
gives to intentionality; in Heidegger's view, human existence itself is
necessarily prior (for this reason Heidegger is sometimes referred to as
an [[existentialism]]
philosopher, although he himself did not subscribe to that view).
Merleau-Ponty's more sympathetic critique of Husserl also took issue
with the priority of intentionality, but did so by foregrounding the
precognitive capacities of the body itself. It is for this reason---his
emphasis on the body---that Merleau-Ponty's work continues to be read,
even though phenomenology as a whole has declined considerably in
importance.
