[[Pêcheux, Michel]] 
(1938--83)


French [[Marxism]]
philosopher and linguist. Pêcheux studied with [[Althusser, Louis]] at the École
Normale Supérieure from 1959 to 1961, quickly becoming part of the
select group of students subsequently known as Althusserians---these
included [[Balibar, Étienne]],
[[Macherey, Pierre]], [[Poulantzas, Nicos]], and [[Rancière, Jacques]]. On graduation,
he obtained a position in a social psychology laboratory at the Centre
Nationale de Recherche Scientifique. There he attempted to apply
Althusser's thinking to social science topics, focusing specifically on
linguistics. He published a manifesto of sorts along these lines
entitled *L'Analyse automatique du discours* (1969) (Automatic Discourse
Analysis), in which he sought to understand language as a social
practice that contributes both to the maintenance of certain ideological
positions, but also the formation of subjectivity. Pêcheux rejects
[[suture]]'s casting of the
[[allegory]]
distinction, arguing that such formalisms served ideological rather than
analytic purposes. Pêcheux's best known work in English is *Language,
Semantics and Ideology* (1982), which is a translation of *Les Vérités
de la Palice* (1975).
