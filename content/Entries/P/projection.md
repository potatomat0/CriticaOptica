[[projection]]

 In
[[psychoanalysis]], the
process of transposing thoughts generated by the
[[psyche]] onto the outside
world, thus enabling the subject to rid themselves of character traits
they would prefer not to see themselves have. For example, as [[Freud, Sigmund]] argues, gothic tales
and horror stories give body to nameless and essentially empty anxieties
and fears as well as desires that most people have. It can take more
paranoid forms, too, such as the subject who is uncertain about their
ability to remain faithful who then projects infidelity onto their
partner. Projection is central to the work of [[Klein, Melanie]], who employs it in
her account of childhood development to explain how children 'act out'
their internal thoughts. So when a child deliberately breaks a toy they
could be seen as projecting their own sense of helplessness in the
family situation. *See also*
