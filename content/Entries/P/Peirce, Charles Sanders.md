[[Peirce, Charles Sanders]]
(1839--1914) American philosopher, one of the founders of both
[[pragmatism]] and
[[semiotics]]. A true
polymath with interests spanning the full spectrum from the hard
sciences to the humanities, Peirce wrote voluminously on an incredibly
wide range of subjects (mathematics, physics, geodesy, spectroscopy,
astronomy, anthropology, psychology, and philosophy, to name but a few),
but published little in his own lifetime, and even today in spite of
considerable editorial efforts the vast bulk of his work remains
unpublished. As it stands, his published output runs to 12,000 pages,
while his unpublished output is in excess of 80,000 handwritten pages,
not all of them well preserved. It is probably fair to say his true
legacy is yet to be fully appreciated; certainly in his own lifetime the
scale of his achievement was exceedingly little known.
Peirce was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a prominent
professor of mathematics at Harvard University. He was one of the
founders of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, where Peirce would later
find employment thanks to his father's influence, and one of the
founders of the Smithsonian Institute. Peirce followed in his father's
footsteps and went to Harvard too, where he completed a BA, MA, and MSc
in rapid succession. In his time at Harvard he was fortunate enough to
gain the friendship of the great American philosopher William James, who
would provide crucial assistance to him throughout his life; he was also
unfortunate enough to make an enemy of Charles Eliot, who would become
president of Harvard and effectively block his chances of employment
there. From 1859 until 1891, Peirce was employed by the US Coast and
Geodetic Survey and was by all accounts a terrible employee, using his
time to pursue his own projects.
The unfortunate fact that Peirce never held a tenured university
position (he was a part-time lecturer at Johns Hopkins University for
years, his only academic appointment) coupled with the entirely
haphazard way in which he wrote and published has meant that the
dissemination of his ideas has followed a slow and uncertain path. In
[[critical theory]], it has
undoubtedly been Peirce's theory of semiotics which has been the most
influential, while philosophy has tended to focus more on his theory of
logic and his notion of pragmatism. But Peirce himself always held that
logic and semiotics were inseparable since thought could not take place
except by means of [[sign]].
His theory of semiotics influenced scholars as diverse as [[Deleuze, Gilles]] (who makes
extensive use of it in his books on cinema), [[Eco, Umberto]], and [[Kristeva, Julia]].
Peirce took what might be termed a pansemiotic view of things, meaning
that he thought that literally everything, from chemical reactions to
human communication, could be understood from a semiotic perspective.
His theory of signs was constructed with this in mind. Peirce's work has
at its core a system of three interrelated universal categories, which
he simply named firstness, secondness, and thirdness. These terms are
slippery, but taken together offer a powerful
[[ontology]]: firstness is a
mode of being which does not require reference to anything else, it
exists in a state of immediacy; secondness, in contrast, is precisely a
category of reference, of comparison and reflection, an intermediary
state of relatedness; thirdness is pure mediation, it combines first and
second things with other first and second things, as in memory and
synthesis. The sign, as Peirce conceives it, belongs to the category of
thirdness.
Peirce's model of the sign has three components, rather than the basic
two adopted by [[suture]],
which he termed the
[[representamen]], the
interpretant, and the
[[object]]. The representamen
is something which creates in the mind of an observer an equivalent
sign; that sign is in turn the interpretant, namely the observer's
representation to themselves of what they have seen; this representation
in turn becomes an object, namely the significance to the observer of
the original sign. Since every sign creates an interpretant, which in
turn becomes a representamen to another interpretant, and so on,
semiosis (the process of sign production) must be regarded as infinite.
There can be no first or last sign. To distinguish between these moments
in the cycle of sign production, Peirce constructed an elaborate
taxonomy of the parts of the sign.
