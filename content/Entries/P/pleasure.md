[[pleasure]] 

(*plaisir*)

**
**1.** In a number of books and essays, starting with the pointedly
titled *Le Plaisir du texte* (1973), translated as *The Pleasure of the
Text* (1975), French literary critic [[Barthes, Roland]] used the
essentially untranslatable distinction between *plaisir* and
[[jouissance]] as a crucial
pivot around which his thinking on culture and literature turned.
Unhappily, the English translation of *The Pleasure of the Text* blunts
the significance of this distinction by rendering 'jouissance' as
'bliss', which lacks the force of the French original whose nearer
cognates include 'orgasm' and 'coming'. For Barthes the distinction is
political: *plaisir* is a conscious, subject-centred form of enjoyment
capable of being put into words, but for that reason it is compliant and
sedate; whereas jouissance is unconscious and inexpressible, and thus
revolutionary and violent. Insofar as we experience *plaisir* we remain
within ourselves, while jouissance threatens to dissolve or destabilize
our selfhood. Extending this logic to literature, Barthes squares up
this distinction with the one he later makes between [[alternate modernity]] texts, equating the
former with *plaisir* and the latter with jouissance.
**2.** The second volume of [[Foucault, Michel]]'s unfinished
series of books on the history of sexuality, entitled *L'Usage des
plaisirs* (1984), translated as *The Uses of Pleasure* (1985),
problematized pleasure in a number of ways that have subsequently become
influential, particularly in [[Cultural Studies]]. At the level of
language, Foucault observed that the Ancient Greeks and Romans did not
have a single word, like pleasure, capable of referring to such a wide
variety of acts and affects. Thus his history tries to show how and why
a word like 'pleasure' became necessary. Consistent with his earlier
work on medicine, Foucault shows that the term 'pleasure' performs a
regulatory function, but the way that regulatory function applies varies
geographically and historically. For example, Christian doctrine
proscribes certain types of pleasure because they divert the believer
from the true path. By contrast, the Ancient Greeks regarded pleasure as
a subsidiary issue to the more important matter of the ethics of one's
acts. Foucault's concept of pleasure is as open-ended as his concept of
power, but interestingly he is quite adamant that pleasure is a better
term than [[desire]] (in
contrast to in the work of his close friend [[Deleuze, Gilles]]).
