[[phallocentrism]]

 Any theory
of sexuality which gives primacy to either or both the penis and the
[[phallus]]. [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s biographer Ernest
Jones coined the phrase in his discussion of the sexuality of young
girls, which challenged the master's view that everything can be
explained by reference to the penis. In contrast to Freud, who thought
that girl's sexuality is defined by their envious desire for a penis and
its frustrated compensation in the form of a baby, Jones argued that
young girls are in fact aware of their own sexual organs and do not
require the penis as a point of comparison in order to organize their
own sexuality.
