[[praxis]]

 The Greek word for
'doing' which is widely used in [[critical theory]] to signify purposive
and purposeful human activity, that is to say human activity with a
specific goal and a tangible outcome. The most prominent and completely
theorized use of the term praxis is undoubtedly to be found in
[[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s
*Critique de la raison dialectique* (1960), translated as *Critique of
Dialectical Reason* (1976); but important discussions are also to be
found in the work of the Italian
[[Marxism]] [[Gramsci, Antonio]]. In some quarters,
praxis is a synonym for
[[resistance]]. It is used to
designate any action that consciously interrupts the
[[hegemony]] status quo.
