[[paranoid-critical method]]
Spanish artist Salvador Dalí's proposed second phase of
[[Surrealism]] which, in
contrast to the first phase, would seek to consciously exploit its
explorations of the unconscious. In other words, rather than simply try
to reveal the workings of the unconscious through automatic writing and
so forth, it proposes to create systematic objectifications of the
delirious connections made by the unconscious. The Dutch architect Rem
Koolhaas provides a fine account of this method in *Delirious New York*
(1978), in which he argues that Dalí's view of things can be witnessed
in a range of late twentieth-century building projects (his key example
is the reconstruction of London Bridge in Arizona). Paranoia, Koolhaas
argues, is a delirium of interpretation in which every thing perceived
serves to confirm the reality of the mind. It is a perpetual feeling of
the shock of recognition. In artistic terms, it is like the fabrication
of facts to evidence an unprovable worldview, and the insertion of those
false facts into the world in such a way as they take the place of true
facts. A clear example of this is Dalí's illustrations for Lautréamont's
*Chants de Maldoror* (1868), which radically reinterpret François
Millet's bucolic paintings as charged with sexual energy.
