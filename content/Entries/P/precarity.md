[[precarity]]

 A state of being
defined by its insecurity and vulnerability. It is an expansive concept,
used to apply to a wide variety of situations in which people feel
precarious, but it tends to be used to refer to people who are
unemployed, underemployed, or insecurely employed. It is also possible
to distinguish between groups of people whose situation is more
precarious than others---e.g. refugees are generally in a greater state
of precarity than people who are unemployed but residing within the
borders of a state in which they can claim citizenship. Precarity has
both a subjective or existential dimension and an objective or empirical
dimension. In the first case it applies to a feeling, but also a frame
of mind, a way of seeing the world. In the latter case it refers to
(largely) economic indicators that point to a shift in employment
conditions in First World countries away from secure, so-called
'lifelong' jobs with 'living wages' towards 'flexible', 'zero-hours'
contracts that force even highly trained professional people to live pay
cheque to pay cheque. In his book *The Precariat: The New Dangerous
Class* (2011), Guy Standing named people in this situation the
precariat, defining them as a fourth class of people below the level of
the previously bottom of the social heap proletariat. The problem, as
Standing explains, is that the precariat live in such difficult
circumstances that they have little or no political voice (they are
generally excluded from unions or other kinds of labour organization)
and little opportunity for solidarity with people in their own situation
(if they refuse to work under a particular set of conditions, their
refusal is quickly undermined by someone else offering to take their
place out of sheer desperation and physical need). Precarity can thus be
characterized as a 'race to the bottom'. Subjectively, this is
characterized as a 'broken promise', i.e. a failure on the part of
governments to guarantee a 'good life' for all its citizens,
particularly those who perceive themselves to be hard-working and yet
not receiving the same benefits as other secure workers.
[[Butler, Judith]] gives this
concept a more rigorously philosophical cast in *Frames of War: When is
Life Grievable?* (2009), where it is used as a starting point, or
foundation point, for an attempt to construct an ethics in step with
contemporary conditions, specifically a media-saturated
[[biopolitics]] world. To do
so, she distinguishes between precariousness and precarity:
precariousness is a general condition of all life---all life is
precarious, not just this or that life. All life is vulnerable in the
sense that it has a defined set of needs which must be met: we have to
eat, drink, and sleep, or we literally die. In this way it calls into
question the [[ideology]] of
individualism which holds that 'my' life is always the most important or
indeed the only important life to consider. By contrast, precarity is a
politically induced state. It refers to a situation in which a person or
group of persons have been pushed into a state of precariousness by
circumstances beyond their control, e.g. refugees. Precarity in this
sense is a condition of maximum vulnerability for which there is no
obvious source of relief. The statelessness of refugees means that no
state is obliged to come to their aid and give them shelter; they are
therefore 'let to die' as [[Agamben, Giorgio]] has put it.
Butler's project consists in asking how the perception of precarity can
be used to ground an ethics of life. Her answer to this question is
rather uncertain because, while she thinks the recognition of precarity
imposes upon us an obligation to act to ameliorate that perceived state
of precariousness, she also acknowledges that it is not guaranteed.
