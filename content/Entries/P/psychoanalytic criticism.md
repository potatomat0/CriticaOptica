[[psychoanalytic criticism]]
The application of
[[psychoanalysis]] to the
understanding of cultural texts, particularly literary and filmic texts.
The originator of psychoanalysis, [[Freud, Sigmund]], was fascinated by
cultural texts and made extensive references to them throughout his
writings. Indeed, one might argue that the foundational concept of the
[[Oedipus complex]] is a
product of Freud's interest in literature, inasmuch that he speculates
that Sophocles' play still has a hold on us some 2,500 years after it is
written because it dramatizes a universal experience. But Freud's most
important thoughts on the subject are to be found in two short essays,
one on daydreams, the other on the notion of the
[[uncanny]]. In the first
essay, 'Der Dichter und das Phantasieren' (1908), translated as
'Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming' (1959), Freud argued that creative
writing is a form of play in which the writer creates a fantasy world
that he or she takes seriously. The artistry of writing lies in
disguising, or better yet
[[sublimation]] the libidinal
dimensions of the fantasy world so that readers will not be put off or
embarrassed by it. In the second essay, 'Das Unheimliche' (1919),
translated as 'The Uncanny' (1955), Freud argued that literature's
ability to unsettle us stems from the way it reminds readers of their
own traumatic, but
[[unconscious]] events of
childhood. In this way, Freud laid out the two main pathways that
psychoanalytic criticism has followed since: on the one hand, it has
tried to use the author's life to understand their work, to see their
creations as the product of unconscious desires; while on the other
hand, it has tried to understand the effect creative works have by
discerning in them repetitions of common symptoms and neuroses that all
readers can identify with. In both cases, then, the creative work is
apprehended as the representation of an unconscious wish, either the
author's or the reader's. The body of research in this field is immense
and includes many of the leading names in [[critical theory]]. Currently, the most
prominent theorist in the field is Slavoj Žižek, but one must also
mention the challenge to psychoanalysis posed by [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]]---they do not
reject psychoanalysis as many people think, but they do dispute the core
idea of psychoanalytic criticism that all texts are so many rehearsals
of unconscious fantasies. They argue that texts are better seen as
machines that carry out essential psychic work.
