[[posthumanism]]

 The critical
perspective that the age of
[[humanism]] has come to an
end. It is premised on the idea that humanism's twin assumptions that
humans are both knowable and reasonable is false. It rejects the idea
that humans can be known, largely on the grounds that the dividing line
between human and non-human or animal is difficult to delineate and
highly permeable. [[Haraway, Donna]]'s work on cyborgs
is especially important in this regard. It also rejects the idea that
because humans have reason (or at least bestow upon themselves the idea
that they have reason), this is sufficient to make them the only
arbiters of the fate of the planet and all its other non-human
inhabitants. Posthumanism is a highly eco-conscious discourse.
