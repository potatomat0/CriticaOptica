[[phantasmagoria]]

 A form of
projection invented in France in the late eighteenth century. A
precursor to cinema, phantasmagoria is able to make images move, thereby
creating a more effective illusion. In its earliest form, the
representations it projected were presented as ghosts, juxtaposing
old-fashioned superstitions with new technology. This paradoxical
conjunction of the old and the new caught the attention of German
cultural theorist [[Benjamin, Walter]], who used the
term 'phantasmagoria' to describe the shopping arcades that emerged in
Paris in the mid-nineteenth century. Now the term is used in [[critical theory]] as a general term for
an interest in or fascination with what later
[[postmodern]] theorists like
[[Eco, Umberto]] would call
[[hyperreality]].
