[[power]]

 In *The History of
Sexuality* (1976) Michel Foucault proposed that
[[sex]] cannot be understood
in isolation from power because it is subject to a variety of
controlling and regulating
[[discourse]], but, that
having been said, power cannot be understood purely in terms of
repression. Clarifying his thinking about power, Foucault said he did
not mean a group of institutions and mechanisms designed to ensure the
subservience of subjects. Similarly, he did not see it as a general
system of domination exerted by one group over another. Sovereignty, the
rule of law, and domination are, he says, only the terminal states power
takes, and do not constitute useful starting points for thinking about
power, Rather, he said, power has to be understood as a form of
positivity, a productive force in its own right, one that takes the form
of a multiplicity of force relations immanent in a particular context in
which they operate. Power is everywhere, Foucault famously said, not
because it is invincible, but because it is produced from one moment to
the next and comes from everywhere. Foucault offered five propositions
in support of this way of seeing power: (1) power cannot be acquired or
shared; it is exercised from innumerable points and always in the
interplay of relations; (2) relations of power are not exterior to other
types of relationships, but immanent in them; (3) power comes from
below---domination is a
[[hegemony]] effect; (4)
power relations are both intentional and non-subjective; and (5) where
there is power, there is resistance.
