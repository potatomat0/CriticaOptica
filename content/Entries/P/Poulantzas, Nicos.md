[[Poulantzas, Nicos]]
(1936--79) Paris-based Greek
[[Marxism]] philosopher and
sociologist. Born and educated in Greece, Poulantzas was active in the
student movement in the 1950s. He was a member of the Greek Democratic
Alliance, which was the euphemism used by the outlawed Greek Communist
Party. After completing his law degree in the late 1950s, he moved to
Paris to undertake a PhD in the philosophy of law. There he met and was
influenced by [[Althusser, Louis]]. But although
Poulantzas came to be considered an 'Althusserian', his work maintained
its own distinctive character and edge. He came into prominence as a
theorist of the state---he engaged the doyen of the British New Left,
historian Ralph Miliband in a long-running debate on the theory of the
state in the pages of the *New Left Review*. Poulantzas argued that the
state serves the interests of capital by providing the minimum level of
social order needed to enable business to flourish. It solicits the
legitimation of this social order by cultural means, particularly
through the imagery and rhetoric of nation, but also (and more
insidiously) through tokenistic concessions to organized labour. In so
doing, Poulantzas borrowed from and reinterpreted Italian Marxist
[[Gramsci, Antonio]]'s concept
of [[hegemony]], giving
[[ideology]] an affirmative
rather than purely manipulative role to play in the formation and
reproduction of the state. He was particularly interested in examining
the reasons behind the failure of dictatorships to endure in spite of
their powerful repressive measures. His main works were: *Political Power and Social Classes* (1973); *Fascism and Dictatorship* (1974);
*The Crisis of Dictatorships* (1976); and *State, Power, Socialism*
(1978).
