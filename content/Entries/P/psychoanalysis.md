[[psychoanalysis]]

 A means of
investigating the
[[unconscious]] dimension of
the human mind established by [[Freud, Sigmund]] on the basis of his
self-analysis and his experience as a practising clinician dealing with
[[hysteria]] and
[[projection]] patients. Freud
himself stated that psychoanalysis has three dimensions: it is (i) a
method for investigating the unconscious meanings of the things patients
say and do; (ii) a therapeutic technique; and (iii) a cluster of
inter-related theories that attempt to explain systematically the
functioning of the psychical apparatus.
It is described in this way, as a cluster of theories, because although
Freud was responsible for initiating psychoanalysis, he was rapidly
joined by a large number of other practitioners, who, in due course,
contributed their own theories, sometimes building on Freud's own work
and taking it further, and sometimes challenging his hypotheses and
offering counter-proposals. In time, schools and factions developed and
psychoanalysis as a movement fractured along a variety of fault lines,
making it impossible to describe it as being just one thing. Although
the different schools of thought in psychoanalysis share a number of
common points, the differences between them can be quite radical, as
splinter groups initiated by [[Jung, Carl]], [[Klein, Melanie]], and others show
very well.
[[Lacan, Jacques]], one of
Freud's most important interpreters (particularly from the perspective
of [[critical theory]]),
frequently insisted that Freud's theories can only be fully understood
in the context of the analytic situation, that is to say, in the context
of the therapeutic relation between the analyst and analysand (patient).
His famous battle cry that psychoanalysis needed to 'return to Freud'
meant precisely this: the core of psychoanalysis is
[[transference]], the
relationship between analyst and analysand. The history of the
development of psychoanalysis tends to bear out Lacan's claim inasmuch
that psychoanalysis as we know it today wasn't born until Freud
abandoned both hypnosis (a technique he adopted from the great French
neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot and refined further with his colleague
Josef Breuer) and [[seduction theory]], which he did when he
found them both to be therapeutically limiting.
Freud stopped using hypnosis because he realized that what people say
freely, without suggestion, is *more* not less indicative of what is
happening in their unconscious, provided one knows how to interpret it.
As he later demonstrated at length in *Zur Psychopathologie des
Alltagslebens* (1901), translated as *The Psychopathology of Everyday
Life* (1914), the little repetitions, hesitations, mistakes, and so on
we routinely make in everyday conversation can all betray the workings
of the unconscious. He abandoned seduction theory when he realized that
the stories his patients were telling him, which frequently included
accounts of childhood rapes and what would later be known as
[[field]] fantasies, could
not all be true, even if the patients insisted they were. The path of
psychoanalysis was henceforward to comprehend the mechanisms of the
unconscious, or what Freud called the primary processes.
Having ruled out actual seduction, Freud had to explain both the fact
that fantasies can have such a strong effect and the seeming
omnipresence of sex in those fantasies. He was able to do so by
proposing a [[topography]] of
the psychical apparatus, separating it into three distinct but
interconnected spheres: the unconscious, the preconscious, and the
conscious. The unconscious, he argued, is where the
[[instinct]] (of which there
are two main types---the life instinct and death instinct, both of which
are intimately related to sex) reside and these instincts exert a
constant pressure on the other parts of the psychical apparatus, but
they cannot pass through the preconscious into the conscious in their
raw form without causing a psychic disturbance. They are held in place
by a powerful counterforce he called
[[repression]]. Repression
does not necessarily mean absolute negation, it can also take the form
of distortion
([[dreamwork]]), which
disguises unacceptable thoughts and impulses in an acceptable form.
Neuroses, he then reasoned, are caused either by the exhausting effort
of maintaining this repression and/or because the effort had failed.
One of Freud's earliest patients, Fräulein Anna O (later identified as
Bertha van Pappenheim), whom he wrote about in *Studien über Hysterie*
(1895), translated as *Studies on Hysteria* (1955), described
psychoanalysis as a [[talking cure]] because Freud's
therapeutic technique consisted in asking patients to describe their
dreams, or recent activities, and then ask them to think through and
talk about all the associations that came to mind as they did so. By
this means his patients became gradually aware of the operations of the
unconscious. Interestingly, Freud did not generally interpret people's
dreams for them, but rather taught them the means of analysing them
themselves. Some patients resisted this process, a fact that Freud
usually interpreted as meaning they actually needed it, while others
became all but addicted to it, a problem he never fully resolved.
Psychoanalysis is undoubtedly one of the most influential intellectual
movements of the past century. Although he was highly critical of
psychoanalysis, [[Foucault, Michel]] nevertheless
described Freud as a 'founder of discourse' because his work created the
possibility of a new way of thinking and speaking about the human
subject. Its influence is all but incalculable---it is vital to
[[critical theory]], the
[[Frankfurt School]],
[[Dada]],
[[Surrealism]], and literary
studies, just to mention a few of the more obvious fields where its
impact has been substantial.
