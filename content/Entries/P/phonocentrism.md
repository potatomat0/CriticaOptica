[[phonocentrism]]

 The
privileging or prioritizing of the acoustic or phonic dimension of
language over the graphic or written dimension. As [[Derrida, Jacques]] demonstrates with
his concept [[différance]],
which in French is pronounced the same as '*différence*',
[[phoneme]] are not the only
meaningful unit of language; one must also take the written (or what
Derrida refers to as the grammatological) into account as well.
