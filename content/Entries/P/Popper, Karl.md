[[Popper, Karl]] 
(1902--94)


Austrian-born, but British-based philosopher of science and politics. He
is widely regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the
latter half of the twentieth century, particularly for his concept of
the 'open society', which lauds western liberal democracy over the
supposedly closed societies of the eastern communist countries.
Popper was born in Vienna to a middle-class family of converted Jews.
His father taught law at the University of Vienna, where Popper received
his education. As a student he joined the Social Democratic Party of
Austria, but soon grew disillusioned with its
[[Marxism]]
[[ideology]], particularly
the constraints on scientific thinking the doctrine of [[historical materialism]] appeared to
impose. He graduated with a doctorate in psychology in 1928.
In 1934 he published his first, and perhaps his most famous book, *Logik der Forschung* (which he translated himself and republished in English
in 1959 as *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*), which argued that the
philosophy of science needed to be rethought from the ground up.
Science, Popper argued, could not be thought in terms of the discovery
of universal truths, but had rather to be thought in terms of
provisional, but ultimately falsifiable, propositions that are true
until someone can disprove them. He rejected the empiricist model of
science which holds that on the basis of the observation of data it is
possible to arrive at universal truths by induction. Only that which is
falsifiable is scientific he argued and on this basis he repudiated both
[[psychoanalysis]] and
Marxism's claims to that status.
Aware of the threat Austria's proposed Anschluss with Nazi Germany posed
to a Jew like himself Popper emigrated to New Zealand in 1937. He
remained there until after the war, and then accepted a post at the
London School of Economics which he held until his retirement. His
colleagues there included fellow philosophers of science [[Feyerabend, Paul]] and [[Lakatos, Imre]] and the eminent
economist and free-market champion Friedrich Hayek. His most famous
student, billionaire financier George Soros, named his philanthropic
foundation after Popper's 1945 book *Open Society and Its Enemies*.
Popper had considerable difficulty in getting *Open Society and Its
Enemies* (which was written while he was in New Zealand), published,
which in light of its later fame is perhaps hard to imagine. However, it
was not until the Cold War began in earnest in the early 1950s that its
message began to resonate. *Open Society and its Enemies* applies
Popper's critique of inductive reasoning to political philosophy, to
attack 'historicism' in the political philosophy of Plato, Marx, and
[[genre]], for which he
blames most of what took place during World War II. But as [[Anderson, Perry]] has pointed out
in *English Questions* (1992), Popper's attack is based on the rather
threadbare premise that historicism means only social sciences which
take historical prediction as their aim, which is hardly the case.
Neither Marx nor Hegel claim to predict history.
With the end of the Cold War, Popper's stock as political philosopher
has gone into steady decline, but his work as philosopher of science
seems to be holding its own despite powerful critiques from his former
colleagues Feyerabend and Lakatos.
