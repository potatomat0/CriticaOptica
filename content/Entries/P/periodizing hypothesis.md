[[periodizing hypothesis]]

 The
attempt to delineate and characterize a particular period of history as
an 'age', e.g.
[[postmodernism]]. It assumes
two things: first, that there is difference in kind (not just degree)
between one moment in history and another; second, that there is
something that gives a particular segment of time a certain kind of
unity. In recent memory, the 1960s stands out as the most widely talked
about example of period: according to some historians, it differs
significantly from the 1950s because it is dominated by the 'youth
culture' of the so-called baby boomer generation; it is unified by a
shift in the [[structure of feeling]] away from believing
in the idea of government towards a more dissident and rebellious
position. Today, it is probably the notion of
[[globalization]] that is the
most talked about example of a periodizing hypothesis, though not
everyone recognizes it as such (i.e. there are those who refuse it on
the grounds that international trade has always been around).

of Theory* (2008).
