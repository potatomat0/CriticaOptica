[[persona]]

 The mask, role, or
character which society expects individuals to present. Swiss
psychologist [[Jung, Carl]]
used this term, which literally means 'mask', to describe the different
social roles people are called on to play in [[everyday life]]. The complaint made by
[[feminism]] critics that
society demands that women be wives, mothers, mistresses, and so on, all
at once, is in effect a statement about both the significance of
personae in daily life and the difficulties they present when they come
into conflict with one another. What is crucial, though, about this
notion of persona is the fact the subject is always conscious of the
fact that 'they' are never quite 'that', they are never quite what they
appear to be. This is a potential source of both anxiety and comfort.
Obeying the same logic, persona is also used in literary studies to
describe the character an author adopts to tell a particular story. This
concept is especially useful in the case of first person narratives to
distinguish the 'I' of the text from the actual author.
