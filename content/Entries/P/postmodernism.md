[[postmodernism]]

 A highly
contested term used to signify a critical distance from
[[modernism]]. Since it first
came to prominence in the mid-1970s, it has given rise to a vast body of
literature in virtually every discipline in the humanities and social
sciences. Broadly speaking, though, it has been used in three main ways:
(i) to name the present historical period; (ii) to name a specific style
in art and architecture; (iii) to name a point of rupture or disjuncture
in epistemology (for this reason it is often, mistakenly, equated with
[[post-structuralism]] and
[[deconstruction]]). Attempts
have been made to standardize usage so that when the historical period
is intended the term 'postmodernity' is used, whereas if it is the
aesthetic dimension that is at issue the term 'postmodernism' is used,
with the term 'postmodern' being reserved for epistemological
references. Pedagogically useful as this standardization of terminology
is, the uptake of it is very far from universal.
In *The Origins of Postmodernity* (1998), Perry Anderson traces the
first appearance of the notion of postmodernism to the work of the
literary critic Frederico de Onís, who used the word 'postmodernismo'
(in a foreword to a collection of contemporary Hispanophone poetry he
edited in 1934) to describe what he saw as a short-lived reactionary
reflux within modernism itself (i.e. precisely the opposite meaning to
the one it would subsequently attain). Although it gained widespread
usage in Spanish and Portuguese criticism, both in Europe and Latin
America, it didn't pass into the Anglophone world until 1954, when the
great English historian Arnold Toynbee used it in an essentially
negative way in the eighth volume of his *A Study of History* to name
the period beginning with the Franco-Prussian War (1870--1). However,
Toynbee's deployment of the term did not catch on. It was, rather, the
contemporaneous usage of the term---initially only in private
correspondence---by the 'Black Mountain Poets' Charles Olson and Robert
Creeley, who were the first to use it in a sense consistent with how the
term is understood today, that was to prove influential.
Olson and Creeley used the term 'post-modern' to describe both a shift
in history and a specific poetic project they developed in relation to
that shift. But neither poet produced a durable doctrine and the term
fell into disuse again, only to be picked up a few years later at the
dawn of the 1960s by two scions of the New York Left, C. Wright Mills
and Irving Howe. If in the hands of Olson and Creeley the term
postmodern had acquired a certain affirmative meaning, Mills and Howe
quickly restored its pejorative sense: they mobilized the term to
describe a general slackening of commitment to the political ideals
embodied in the notions of communism and socialism. At the end of the
1960s, its meaning was once more reversed by the literary critic Leslie
Fiedler who used it in a CIA-sponsored conference to celebrate the
emergence of a new 'youth-culture' sensibility prioritizing personal
expression and civil rights over work and the needs of the state. To
this point, the use of the term postmodern was sporadic and
inconsistent, functioning more as a suggestive adjective than a viable
concept. But that soon changed.
In 1971, Egyptian-born literary and cultural critic Ihab Hassan produced
a vast survey of works (across all the arts, but focused particularly on
literature and music) that in his view could no longer be described as
modern because their organizing impetus was radically different from
modernism, and had therefore to be labelled postmodern. Interestingly,
his key exhibits of this new style were John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg,
and Buckminster Fuller, all names associated with Black Mountain
College. Hassan argued that these artists (together with the likes of
Ashbery, Barth, Barthelme, Pynchon, and Warhol) were anarchic in spirit
and inclined towards playful indeterminacy rather than the Olympian
aloofness which he associated with modernism. Although willing to see
the postmodern as a form of 'epistemic break' (a term he adapted from
[[Foucault, Michel]]) akin to
other forms of the
[[avant-garde]], such as
[[Dada]] and
[[Surrealism]], he refused to
see it as a historic break and pulled back from making any connection
between the new art form and changes in society. Thus, for Hassan
postmodernism was essentially a passing fad in the history of the arts
and it was soon overtaken by what he called post-postmodernism.
It took the architectural historian Charles Jencks to connect the dots
and link the artistic avant-garde with social change and contrive a
vision of the postmodern that would finally capture the attention of the
mainstream. Somewhat gnomically, Jencks pronounced that the previous era
came to an end at precisely 3.32 p.m. on 15 July 1972, with the
demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe social housing estate in St Louis,
designed by the architect responsible for the twin towers of the World
Trade Center in New York, Minoru Yamasaki (this coincidence has not gone
unremarked, and there are those who suggest that it is the destruction
of the latter that actually marks the true advent of postmodernity).
Jencks reasoned that the destruction of these buildings marked the end
of the idea (largely associated with utopian architects like Le
Corbusier) that social change could be effected through architecture,
and more generally the end of the idea that it is government's role to
attempt to effect social change. It also signalled the acceptance of the
idea that the global market is the true arbiter of the social. Jencks
saw in this gesture a refreshing willingness to break with the past and
it was this aspect of postmodernism that his writing emphasized. But he
also hoped that the proliferation of new styles which this changed
attitude to tradition enabled would give rise to a kind of
[[polyphony]] harmony of
differences.
Now widely used in architectural and artistic circles, the term
postmodern was still seen as referring primarily to a new style or
fashion in the aesthetic realm and was regarded by many (including those
like Hassan who initially touted the term) as suspiciously modish. The
next statement of the term would deepen its penetration considerably and
apply it to the realm of knowledge itself thus giving the term the
intellectual respectability it had hitherto lacked. Commissioned by the
Conseil des Universités of the government of Quebec, [[Lyotard, Jean-François]]'s *La Condition
postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir* (1979), translated as *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge* (1984) transformed
postmodernism into a concept to be reckoned with, and initiated a
two-decade long debate about its existence. Lyotard famously defined the
postmodern as incredulity towards what he called [[grand narrative]]. By this he meant
(i) the idea that revolution was inevitable and that it would bring with
it beneficial social change; and (ii) the
[[Enlightenment]] ideal that
progress in social terms would be achieved through technological
advancement. The credibility of these grand narratives was destroyed by
World War II, which revealed the hollowness of both---revolution gave
rise to Stalinism and the Enlightenment gave rise to Nazism (here
Lyotard's argument extends several key tenets of Frankfurt School
thinker [[Adorno, Theodor]]'s
work).
The destruction of the grand narratives saw the spawning of a
multiplicity of 'little narratives' or what Lyotard more commonly
referred to as [[language games]] (a notion he adapted
from [[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]]).
Incommensurable with one another, these language games could neither be
subsumed by an overarching or totalizing concept such as
[[contradiction]] nor
integrated by processes like [[Habermas, Jürgen]]'s notion of
consensus or Niklas Luhmann's systems theory. Lyotard is careful to
acknowledge that not all social relations are of this type, but he
nonetheless insists that language games are the minimum form of social
relation. The resulting image of society, which Lyotard terms 'realism',
is that of an agonistics or even a polemics in which each language game
must compete for legitimacy. Unable to appeal to pre-existing grand
narratives for its legitimacy, knowledge now makes do by citing its
efficiency and its practicality. It has to be said that Lyotard paints a
grim portrait of the university system dominated by economic
rationalism, which is only very partially offset by the faith he has in
avant-garde art to keep alive thoughts of the future by, as he puts it,
'waging war on totality'. Although Lyotard speaks of postmodernism as a
historical condition and links the state of knowledge corresponding to
that condition to the kinds of social changes theorized by [[Bell, Daniel]] and others as the
emergence of a [*post-industrial
society](#X7fcc54e68ee5aee3a948a7bbae642512d50af5b), he does not name
the cause of the change. A decade later British Marxist geographer
[[Harvey, David]] would give a
much more thorough answer to this problem in his *The Condition of
Postmodernity* (1989).
The first critic to provide an economic answer to the problem Lyotard
raised was however Marxist cultural critic [[Jameson, Fredric]]. Jameson's work on
postmodernism was developed in instalments over a period of more than 20
years. One can read traces of it in *Marxism and Form* (1971) and *The Political Unconscious* (1981), though in these instances he used the
terms [[consumer society]],
post-industrial society, and [[society of the spectacle]]. He first used the
term postmodernism in a talk entitled 'Postmodernism and Consumer
Society' given at the Whitney Museum of Contemporary Art in the autumn
of 1982. A fuller version of the essay was subsequently published in
*New Left Review* in the spring of 1984 under the new title of
'Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'. This essay
has been enormously influential and for many it offers the definitive,
but by no means infallible, definition of postmodernism. Jameson builds
on Ernest Mandel's argument in *Der Spätkapitalismus* (1972), translated
as *Late Capitalism* (1975), that contemporary capitalism is an
intensification of trends in global economics detected by Marx, rather
than proof that Marx was wrong (as Daniel Bell and others had argued).
Rejecting any suggestion that capitalism has somehow come to an end,
radically changed, or worse attained its apotheosis, Jameson's thesis is
that postmodern culture is the
[[superstructure]]
expression of [[late capitalism]] (meaning simply
the current state of the [[mode of production]]), which for
Jameson means a global situation of economic, military, and political
dominance by the US.
Jameson readily acknowledges that postmodern texts are recognizably
different from modern texts, but in contrast to a lot of critics he is
unwilling to accept that the symptomatic features of postmodernism are
purely textual in origin. Culture, for Jameson, cannot be dissociated
from the economic and political situation in which it must make its way
because the traditional
[[Marxism]] distinction
between them (i.e. the
[[base and superstructure]]
model) has in fact collapsed. Postmodernism, Jameson argues, is the
'cultural revolution' needed to enable contemporary society to adjust
and respond to these changes. His catalogue of five symptoms of
postmodernism---the [[waning of affect]],
[[pastiche]], [[hysterical sublime]], [[geopolitical aesthetic]], and a mutation in
built space that has discombobulated our global [[cognitive map]]---have to be read
against this background.
For many, however, Jameson's account of postmodernism is too
'totalizing' (which certain careless critics have equated with
'totalitarianism', though in reality it means nothing more sinister than
trying to account for the historical situation as a whole) and there
remains a strong counter-current which resists his comprehensive
overview in favour of a highly localized aesthetic and/or
epistemological definition. Canadian literary critic, Linda Hutcheon, is
probably the leading exponent of the purely aesthetic definition of
postmodernism, while the late American philosopher [[Rorty, Richard]] was probably the
principal authority on the epistemological version of postmodernism.
