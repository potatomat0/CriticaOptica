[[political correctness]]

 The
deliberate avoidance of language use and behaviour which may be
perceived to be either derogatory or excluding of a political minority.
Institutions and organizations that adopt political correctness as part
of their communications policy thus expressly forbid the use of racist,
sexist, and otherwise prejudicial language and require that politically
neutral terms be used at all times. So, instead of 'chairman',
'chairperson' is used because it does not imply that the role is in any
way gendered; similarly 'indigenous' has been substituted for 'native'
and/or 'Indian' because it implies prior sovereignty of possession of
the land. Right-wing commentators like to complain about and lampoon
political correctness as a kind of needless or useless language tyranny,
but the fact is the way language is used does matter to people so its
use needs to be subject to oversight. The difficulty comes when trying
to legislate against specific words such as 'nigger' which can either be
an insult or an expression of solidarity depending on the context.
[[Butler, Judith]] offers an
important consideration of this in her discussion of 'hate speech' in
*Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative* (1997).
