[[Propp, Vladimir]]
(1895--1970) Russian literary scholar and founding father of
[[narratology]]. Born in St
Petersburg, he attended St Petersburg University, studying philosophy.
After graduation in 1918, he taught Russian and German at secondary
schools for a number of years before attaining a position at his alma
mater. In 1928 Propp published *Morfológija skázki*, which applied the
principle of [[Russian Formalism]] to the study the
narrative structure of Slavic folktales. The impact of this work was
quite modest to begin with; indeed, it was not until 1960 when [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] wrote an
approving, but nonetheless searching critique of the 1958 English
translation *The Morphology of the Folktale* did it become well known.
Following that, however, its impact was nothing short of seismic: it
reshaped the study of narrative almost completely. [[Barthes, Roland]] translated
Lévi-Strauss's insights into a useable form for literary criticism in
his 1966 essay, 'Introduction à l'analyse structurale des récits',
translated as 'Introduction to Structural Analysis of Narratives'
(1977). Probably the best known and most effective use of Propp's
thought is in the study of genre fiction---[[Eco, Umberto]]'s essay on the
narrative structure of James Bond is perhaps the archetype. Propp set
aside the content of the text, as it were, namely the actual sentences
that comprise the text, and focused exclusively on the abstract form of
the text, paying particular attention to the events (or functions) and
character types in the tale. By sorting out those events and characters
which are crucial to the tale and those which are superfluous, Propp
exposed the [[syntagm]] or
that which is universal to the tale. He argued that there are 31 basic
functions and 7 character types and that all folktales are created using
an amalgam of these standard ingredients.
