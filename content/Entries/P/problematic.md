[[problematic]]

 The French
[[Marxism]] [[Althusser, Louis]] adopted this
term (from the work of Jacques Martin) to describe the source of the
theoretical unity of a particular form of
[[discourse]]. His purpose in
doing so was to distinguish the so-called early or Hegelian Marx from
the later post-Hegelian Marx. The term is widely used in [[critical theory]] today, usually
without any reference to Althusser, as a means of indicating a
theoretical starting point that is at once perplexing and productive.
