[[Practical Criticism]]

 A form
of literary analysis which focuses exclusively on the text, ignoring
such extraneous factors as authorial intention and historical context.
The term originates with an experiment performed on Cambridge literature
students by [[Richards, Ivor Armstrong]]. The students
were given a selection of poems to read and comment on, but they were
not given the titles of the poems, nor were they told anything about who
the authors of the poems were. The idea was that the students should
judge the texts before them solely on the basis of what they had in
front of them. Richards was amazed at how poorly (in his view) the
students performed and concluded that what was needed was more practical
instruction in the art of reading texts. The results of his experiments
(Richards's own background was in fact in psychology) are written up in
the appropriately titled *Practical Criticism: A Study of Literary
Judgement* (1929), which became a kind of handbook for the discipline of
literary studies and had enormous influence. It was however his former
student, [[James, C. L. R.]],
who popularized the method of 'close reading' through the journal,
*Scrutiny*, which he founded. It became the default way of reading
literary texts in most of the Anglophone world. Even after its influence
waned in universities due to the impact of
[[structuralism]] and
[[post-structuralism]] in the
1960s, it remained very much in force in high schools and colleges well
into the 1980s. The exception to this rule was the US, which was instead
gripped by [[New Criticism]],
a home-grown mutation of Practical Criticism, that was similarly
concerned to focus only on the text.
The strength of Practical Criticism was that it set aside the merely
impressionistic responses found in what [[Eagleton, Terry]] describes as the
'belle-lettristic waffle' of the then hegemonic Bloomsbury group of
authors, and brought genuine rigour to the business of reading texts.
Students were taught to better understand the effects of literary
convention and technique (e.g. the role of
[[metaphor]]), and were given
free rein to pronounce judgement on the relative worth of specific
texts. Practical Criticism, particularly its leading avatar F. R.
Leavis, was virtually obsessed with deciding what did and did not belong
in the canon of 'great texts' worthy of further study. While this
enabled literary studies to develop standardized texts and, more
importantly, standardized tests in schools, thus explaining its
incredible influence, it also led to standardized responses to texts and
promoted the idea that only certain responses (i.e. the teacher's) could
be considered valid. Because Practical Criticism ignored both the
author's and the reader's background and was only interested in
so-called 'universals' like 'truth', it consciously reduced the range of
meanings any text might in fact yield. It was this factor more than
anything that led to its eventual demise as other methods celebrating
diversity of meaning came into fashion. But it was also attacked from a
political perspective for ignoring the significance of [[identity politics]], particularly
issues to do with [[gender]],
[[race]], and sexuality. The
plurality of possible readings that texts can give rise to is explored
by [[reader-response criticism]].
