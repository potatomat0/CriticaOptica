[[problematization]]

 Probably
the most influential conception of this term derives from [[Foucault, Michel]], whose work on
health, incarceration, madness, and sexuality inquires how each of these
things was rendered problematic, which is to say transformed into
something capable of inducing or requiring action at the level of the
state. In this sense, problematization is one of
[[governmentality]]'s core
processes.
