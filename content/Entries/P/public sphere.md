[[public sphere]]
**(*Öffentlichkeit*)** [[Habermas, Jürgen]]'s term for any
realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed. It comes
into existence whenever a forum is created in which citizens can express
their opinions concerning topics of general---i.e. public---interest,
and those opinions can be subjected to critical debate. The public
sphere should be open to all citizens and everyone within it should be
treated equally. Examples of possible public spheres include newspapers,
magazines, radio news, TV news, and of course the Internet, but it
should be noted not all of these entities necessarily satisfy the
democratic rule concerning access and freedom to express opinion.
Similarly, not everything that is expressed in these outlets is of
public interest. In other words, public sphere is not simply another
word for media. Habermas's thesis is that the public sphere that arose
in the early eighteenth century was eroded by the rise of what [[Foucault, Michel]] called
[[biopower]], the
intervention of the state. Public spheres are historical concepts and in
Habermas's view they can be thought of as being typical of their age.
