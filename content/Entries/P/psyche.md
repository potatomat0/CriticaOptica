[[psyche]]

 The Greek word for
breath and soul 'psukhÄ“', and the name given to Eros' true love. Swiss
analytical psychologist [[Jung, Carl]] used the term to
designate the totality of mental processes, both conscious and
[[unconscious]]. Crucially,
Jung's notion of the psyche allows for autonomous entities, such as
[[complex]], to operate
within its domain. The psyche should thus be viewed as being neither
homogenous nor unified. It is also capable of transformation.
