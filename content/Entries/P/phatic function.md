[[phatic function]]

 One of the
six constitutive elements of verbal communication according to Russian
linguist [[Jakobson, Roman]]
(the other functions are: referential, emotive, poetic, conative, and
metalingual). The phatic function is the part of communication which
keeps open the line of communication itself; it is the means by which
two or more speakers reassure themselves that not only are they being
listened to, but they are also being understood. It is in this sense a
part of communication that is separate from the exchange of meaning; it
is, as it were, without content of its own. Examples include such common
phrases as 'Are you with me?', 'Do you know what I mean?', and so on.
