[[Postcolonial Studies]]

 A
loosely-applied rubric for a large variety of work (creative and
critical) across a range of disciplines---particularly anthropology,
history, and literary studies---with a shared interest in the effects of
colonization on the cultures of both the colonizers and the colonized.
The leading theorists in the field are [[Bhabha, Homi]], [[Spivak, Gayatri]], and [[Said, Edward]]. The field is large
enough for there to be several different sub-fields operating under its
umbrella such as [[feminism]]
postcolonial studies and [[Queer Theory]] and postcolonial
studies.
The origins of Postcolonial Studies are predominantly Anglophone, but a
comparative dimension has blossomed in the past two decades so that
there are now substantial Francophone, Lusophone, Germanophone, and
Hispanophone (as well as many other language groups) bodies of work in
the area as well. The term was originally used by historians and
economists in hyphenated form ('post-colonialism') to describe the
political and economic situation of nations following decolonization,
thus it had a specific historical point of reference. However, it is in
literary studies rather than history that the term has put down its
deepest roots, becoming in the process one of the most important
intellectual movements in the entire discipline, easily outpacing
[[deconstruction]] and [[New Historicism]] whose central
tenets it has in any case absorbed. Postcolonial Studies offers itself
as a radical alternative to the bland and ideologically naive
Commonwealth Literatures project.
Literary studies has deleted the hyphen and with it the precision of
reference it had in history, thus allowing the term to encompass the
analysis of virtually any aspect of colonization, from the Early Modern
or pre-colonial period of European exploration of the globe up to the
present day. The deleting of the hyphen should be regarded as an
essentially polemic gesture problematizing the very idea that
colonialism is something that belongs safely in the past. Indeed, there
are many who would argue that viewed globally we are very far from being
postcolonial inasmuch that there are still many countries where the
institutions, practices, and power relations of colonization are still
very much present (from the perspective of indigenous peoples, this is
true of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US, to name only the
most obvious). Similarly, there are those who observe that, even where
the colonizers have departed, their models of governance remain so that
a situation of
[[neocolonialism]] obtains
(here one might point to Israel and Palestine, whose recent history
offers an even more complex case of the persistence of colonization).
It is difficult to generalize about a field of study as broad as
Postcolonial Studies, but it can be observed that (i) it takes an
anti-essentialist approach to
[[identity]] (though it will
allow the necessity for [[strategic essentialism]]); (ii) it
privileges [[differend]]
over sameness (but acknowledges that difference is not without its
[[ambivalence]]); (iii) its
political outlook is pluralist and
anti-[[hegemony]] (it openly
celebrates [[Creoleness]],
[[diaspora]], and
[[hybridity]], and at the
same time problematizes all forms of
[[subaltern]] and
subjugation); and (iv) it equates
[[representation]] with power
(Said's [[Orientalism]]
thesis has it that the control of representation is an index of power
and the exercise of that control one of the things postcolonial critics
must not tire of exposing). Theoretically, Postcolonial Studies draws on
[[Marxism]] (albeit in a
non-Marxist way),
[[psychoanalysis]]
(particularly on issues to do with
[[alterity]]),
[[drive]],
[[actual]], and to a
limited extent [[Deleuze, Gilles]]
and [[authority]] (especially
their concept of the
[[rhizome]]).
