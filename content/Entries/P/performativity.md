[[performativity]]

 American
philosopher [[Butler, Judith]]
adapts [[Austin, John Langshaw]]'s
concept of the
[[performative]] in her book
*Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity* (1990) to
redefine [[gender]] as an
action humans are compelled to perform by society rather than a state of
being or bodily condition. Her case example, which as she acknowledges
in subsequent books was much misunderstood, is drag or cross-dressing:
drag imitates gender, she argues, and in doing so reveals the imitative
structure of gender itself. Gender can be imitated because it is always
already a performance to begin with. As such, gender does not have an
essence, or an intrinsic nature or identity. What was misunderstood by
many was the fact that this does not mean gender is something we can
therefore opt out of. As Butler clarifies in *Bodies That Matter: On the
Discursive Limits of 'Sex'* (1993), while it is true that we can decide
which aspects of available gender identities we wish to perform, we
cannot choose not to have any gender identity at all because society
constantly imposes gender upon us.
