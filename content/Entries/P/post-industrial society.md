[[post-industrial society]]

 A
society whose economy is no longer based on manufacturing. In 1973, in
*The Coming of Post-Industrial Society*, influential American
sociologist [[Bell, Daniel]]
argued that the transition in the US economy away from manufacturing
towards what he called the service sector (but would today be known as
the information economy) was generalized and the economy as a whole went
through a phase change. Writing at a time of real crisis in the global
economy brought on by the so-called 'Oil Shock' (a massive spike in the
cost of energy engineered by the OPEC member nations), which had a
profoundly negative effect on manufacturing, Bell's work seemed to
capture the [[zeitgeist]]
perfectly. The term itself was coined by French sociologist [[Touraine, Alain]] in *The Post-Industrial Society. Tomorrow's Social History: Classes, Conflicts
and Culture in the Programmed Society* (1969). Both Bell and Touraine
argue that the transformation in the economy brings with it a
transformation in society---in the preceding industrial period it was
the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie that gave
society its cultural coherence. In post-industrial society, the
blue-collar worker recedes in importance, and his or her place is taken
by the so-called white-collar worker, but now there isn't a clear-cut
class distinction to shape society because there is no real significant
difference between them and the bourgeoisie. Theorists, such as [[Jameson, Fredric]] and [[Harvey, David]], would take this
same moment as the starting point for what they prefer to call
[[postmodernism]].
