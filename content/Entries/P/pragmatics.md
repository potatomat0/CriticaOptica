[[pragmatics]]

 A branch of
linguistics which investigates the role context plays in the formation
of meaning. It draws on the [[Austin, John Langshaw]] theory of the
[[performative]], but also
incorporates elements of anthropology and sociology. It is interested in
the way users of a particular language draw on non-linguistic cues to
disambiguate the intent of a particular piece of communication (e.g. to
determine whether a comment was a jest or insult, flirtatious or
harassing, etc.).
