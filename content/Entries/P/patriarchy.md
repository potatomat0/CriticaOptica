[[patriarchy]]

 Initially this
term was used in anthropology to designate a family structure in which
an older male (usually a father or grandfather) is in control of family
life. In [[feminism]] this
term is extended to describe an entire society in which men are in
control on both a micro and macro scale, that is to say, in control of
individual families as well as the principal organs of power.
Patriarchal societies are inherently hierarchical, privileging one group
of people, namely men, over another for no other reason than
[[gender]]. Popular
expressions like 'glass ceiling' reflect this situation in which it
appears that women cannot reach the highest levels in a given society
because of their sex, despite being well qualified to do so.
