[[primal scene]]
**(*Urszene*)** In
[[psychoanalysis]], the
child's first witnessing of its parents having sexual intercourse. The
child makes a threefold interpretation of the act, according to [[Freud, Sigmund]]: first, they
interpret it as an act of aggression on the part of the father; second,
while it excites them, it also induces fear of castration; third, the
child assumes it is anal sex. Freud initially insisted that the primal
scene was actual---that the child had to actually witness the
event---but later came to realize that it could just as well be virtual,
a figment of the imagination.
