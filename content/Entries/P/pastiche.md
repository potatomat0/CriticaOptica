[[pastiche]]

 A work of art (in
the broadest sense) that borrows and mixes artistic styles. In the
programme essay to his magisterial account of
[[postmodernism]],
*Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism* (1991),
[[Jameson, Fredric]]
provocatively claimed that all postmodern art conforms to a logic of
pastiche, which he defined as parody without purpose. That is to say,
postmodernism's purpose in copying previous artistic styles is neither
to exalt nor critique, but simply to use them to create interesting new
works. Postmodernism is compelled to do this Jameson argues because
artistic innovation was effectively exhausted by its precursor
[[modernism]].
