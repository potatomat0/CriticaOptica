[[psychogeography]]

 The study
of the specific effects (and affects) of the built environment (intended
or not) on the emotions and actions of individuals. Although generally
associated with the
[[Situationism]], it
actually dates back to the days before Situationism when its originator
[[Debord, Guy]] was still
involved with the Lettrist International. The term first appeared in an
essay by Debord, in the short-lived Lettrist organ *Potlatch*, entitled
'Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography' (1955). Debord claims
the term was suggested to him by an illiterate Kabyle as a general term
for a variety of phenomena the group was investigating in 1953. Put very
simply the aim of psychogeography was to see the urban space in the
light of desire rather than habit. In order to do that, it experimented
with different ways of getting lost, such as hiking through the Harz
region in Germany using a London map as a guide. But it also implies a
project to reform or re-imagine the city, to make it more desirable by
making it less a product of and service agent for capitalism.
Psychogeography was, and is, very far from an exact science and it is
perhaps best to think of it more as a set of practices designed to
escape the imperatives of the city than a precise concept or
methodology. Having said that, it was not meant to be simply playful
either---its purpose was always serious, even when its methods were not.
Psychogeography did not come to an end with the Situationist movement,
but continues to be developed today. Novelists and cultural historians
such as Iain Sinclair, Peter Ackroyd, Stewart Home, and Will Self, also
consider much of their writing about the secret or inner life of cities
to be exercises in psychogeography. It has also been suggested that the
dark and mysterious tales of the city found in the work of William
Blake, Thomas de Quincy, Charles Baudelaire, and [[Benjamin, Walter]] should be
considered as providing templates for what would become psychogeography.
