[[positivism]]

 The third and
highest state of human knowledge according to nineteenth-century French
philosopher Auguste Comte. According to Comte, humans evolve through
three distinct states of social being: the theological, the
metaphysical, and the positive. The first, primitive state of social
life is the theological, in which humans progress from pagan fetishism
to monotheism; the second, slightly more advanced state, is the
metaphysical, so called because in it humans turn away from the
supernatural, but nonetheless search for secular powers like 'nature';
the third, and final stage, is positivism, in which humans use science
to ask how things work, rather than why they are there. The aim of
positivism is to discover the immutable universal laws governing the
known universe by virtue of scientific analysis and observation.
