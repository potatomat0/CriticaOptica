[[place]]

 A physical location
invested with meaning. A place may be large or small, a city or village,
and it may be tightly circumscribed or vague and uncertain. Think of
what it means to say, for example, 'I have been to Paris'. Paris is a
place and, in saying you have been there, you are saying you have set
foot somewhere in the city, but you could scarcely claim to have seen
the whole city. And yet one has the feeling one has been 'there', that
'there' being a mixture of one's dreams, fantasies, and preconceptions
about the city and the actual experience one has. So the Paris one has
been to is as much a Paris of the mind as it is an actual city, and that
is what makes it memorable and special. The concept of place captures
this overlap between the imaginary and empirical dimensions of
locations, and argues that the latter is mere
[[space]] without the former.
