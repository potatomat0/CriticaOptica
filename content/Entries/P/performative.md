[[performative]]

 British
philosopher [[Austin, John Langshaw]]'s term for a type
of speech that performs an action. For example, the phrase 'I now
pronounce you husband and wife' performs the action of joining two
people in marriage, provided the person who utters it is so empowered.
Performatives do not always have to be as direct as that. If, for
example, someone says 'it is stuffy in here' and we open a window in
response, then it can be said that the phrase has a performative effect.
