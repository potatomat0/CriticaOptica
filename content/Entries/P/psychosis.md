[[psychosis]]

 A
nineteenth-century psychiatric term for madness that was taken up by
[[psychoanalysis]] to
designate severe mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia), which it
contrasted with the less severe disorders of
[[neurosis]]. In general,
psychoanalysis regards psychosis as untreatable because it has as its
main symptom the complete breakdown of communication, thereby making the
[[talking cure]] impossible.
Yet, as the work of [[Lacan, Jacques]] makes plain,
psychoanalysis also regards psychosis as an incredibly important
phenomenon from the point of view of studying how the psychical
apparatus functions. Lacan's theory of the genesis of psychosis hinges
on the failure of the
[[field]] process and the
[[foreclosure]] of
Name-of-the-Father, with the result that
[[symbolic]] order is not
properly formed and the
[[subject]] is locked into a
nightmarish world dominated by the
[[imaginary]]. Unable to
distinguish between the real and the unreal, the psychotic subject
suffers delusional episodes that can make life extremely difficult for
them. [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[Guattari, FÃ©lix]] reject the
psychoanalytic explanation of the genesis of psychosis---in their view,
its genesis can only be organic, i.e. the result of physiological
changes in the brain itself. As a result, their work offers no theory
for the treatment of psychosis; rather, it concentrates on adapting the
world (and not the 'patient') to its symptoms.
