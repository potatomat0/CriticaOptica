[[parapraxis]] [[Freud, Sigmund]]

's actual term for
what is more commonly known as a 'Freudian slip'. Able to take many
forms, from the forgetting of names, to losing one's keys, to
accidentally saying the wrong word, parapraxis is, according to Freud,
an instance of
[[unconscious]] thoughts
escaping censorship and influencing the realm of conscious action. Such
slips, Freud theorized, betray what our unconscious is really thinking.
If, for example, we consistently forget someone's name, that might be a
symptom of our dislike for that person. As Freud shows in *Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagsleben*s (1901), translated as *The Psychopathology of Everyday Life* (1914), parapraxis is extremely common
and widely occurring.
