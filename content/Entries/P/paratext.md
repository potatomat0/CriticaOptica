[[paratext]]

 French literary
theorist [[Genette, GÃ©rard]]'s
term for the framing devices authors and publishers use to contextualize
works and generate interest (e.g. blurbs, subtitles, celebrity
endorsements, and so forth). As Genette points out in *Seuils* (1987)
translated as *Paratexts. Thresholds of Interpretation* (1997), although
not officially part of the text, the paratext can have a significant
influence over the way a text is received.
