[[pragmatism]]

 A branch of
philosophy founded by the American philosophers [[Peirce, Charles Sanders]] and William
James---the latter is credited with coining the term, but he attributes
the concept to Peirce. Pragmatism is distinguished by its interest in
how things work and its foregrounding of belief as an effective mode of
thought---we act on beliefs, even when we have no way of verifying them.
It is interested in the ways by which humans and indeed all organisms
mentally adapt to their environment and create a workable relationship
with it via the elaboration of concepts. *See also*
[[constructivism]].
