[[Bauman, Zygmunt]]
(1925--2017) A UK-based, Polish-born sociologist. Bauman grew up in
Poznan, Poland, but moved to Russia as a youth with his family to escape
the German invasion. He fought with the Polish army, rising to the rank
of major, but was sacked in 1953 because of his Jewishness. He then
turned to academia, but was persecuted by anti-Semites within the
academy, so he decided to leave Poland. He moved to the UK via brief
stints in Tel Aviv and Canberra. A prolific writer, he was the author of
over fifty books, dealing with a wide variety of topics, but principally
focused around the issues of
[[modernity]],
[[postmodernity]], and the
Holocaust. His major works include: *Modernity and the Holocaust*
(1991); *Wasted Lives: Modernity and its Outcasts* (2003);
*Postmodernity and its Discontents* (1997) and *Globalization: The Human
Consequences* (1998).
As this brief list of titles indicates, Bauman's work is primarily
focused on three questions: What constitutes
[[modernity]]? What are its
effects? And what follows modernity? He charted the movement from what
he characterized as 'solid' modernity to the present situation of
[[liquid modernity]] in which
the strong social bonds of family, religion, and country, but also the
economic certainty of full employment, social security, and public
healthcare, have been dissolved by the
[[deterritorialization]]
effects of capital, and
[[precarity]] has become the
norm. This theme gave rise to a veritable stream of books: *Liquid Modernity* (2000), *Liquid Love* (2003), *Liquid Life* (2005), *Liquid Fear* (2006), and *Liquid Times* (2006). From liquidity Bauman
progressed, logically enough, to disposability, in *Wasted Lives*
(2004).
Like [[Baudrillard, Jean]],
Bauman argued that consumption and consumerism have overtaken the place
of work as the main organizing principle of both the economy and social
life. As a consequence, he argued, social cohesion has been reduced to
what he calls 'cloakroom' groups, i.e. groups which come together over a
specific issue such as an anti-war rally only to disperse again when the
event is over. This loss of cohesion is further exacerbated in his eyes
by the premium [[late capitalism]] places on the
individual. Somewhat damningly, but on good evidence, he argued that
modernity has not delivered its promise of emancipation. Following a
similar line of argument to
[[postmodern]] and
[[Horkheimer, Max]]'s *Dialectic of Enlightenment* (1944), Bauman linked the social transformations
wrought by modernity to the Holocaust in *Modernity and the Holocaust*
(1989), arguing that the technology that underpinned the economic growth
that spurred modernity also facilitated the mass killing unleashed by
the Nazi regime. For Bauman, then, the Holocaust was effectively a kind
of murderous [[Fordism]].
