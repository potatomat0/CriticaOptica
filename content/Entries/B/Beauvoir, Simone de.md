[[Beauvoir, Simone de]]
(1908--86) French feminist intellectual, equally well known for her
philosophical works and her novels and autobiographical pieces. Her
landmark text *Le Deuxième Sexe* (1949), translated as *The Second Sex*
(1952), is one of the foundational texts of twentieth-century
[[feminism]]. Its central
thesis is that women are made rather than born. Beauvoir's rejection of
[[biological determinism]]
continues to inform feminist theory today. Although she was widely
acknowledged as a key intellectual of her time, feminist theorists have
always been ambivalent in their reception of her work either because she
herself did not identify with feminism or because of the suspicion that
her work merely replicated
[[precarity]]'s.
Beauvoir's starting point for *The Second Sex* is the assumption, which
she then sets out to substantiate, that the inferior situation of women
is due to historical, political, and social circumstances, and not any
innate characteristic of women. In
[[existentialism]] terms, this
means that if women lack freedom, it is not because they are acting in
[[bad faith]]: their
[[situation]] condemns them
to it. But, as Toril Moi argues in *Simone de Beauvoir: The Making of an
Intellectual Woman* (1994), this also amounts to gendering both freedom
and agency as masculine, which is obviously problematic for any strong
feminist reading of Beauvoir. Compounding this is her classification of
sexual desire, orgasm, pregnancy, breast-feeding, childbirth, and so on,
as merely natural functions, i.e. as lacking the directed form of
consciousness Sartre referred to as a project and deemed necessary to
agency and freedom. However, Moi also argues we do not need to follow
Beauvoir's awkward positioning of these key ideals in order to extract
other more potent theoretical ideas from her work.
The specific that problem women face, according to Beauvoir, is that
their pursuit of freedom takes place in circumstances that in her words
compel them to assume the status of the
[[Other]]. This contradiction
in their existence is specific to women in a patriarchal society. It is
played out in a number of ways, but perhaps most significantly in the
woman's relation to her body: it is her body that makes her a woman, but
it is also this very fact that separates her from herself as a free,
autonomous agent. Although she refuses the idea that biology is destiny,
Beauvoir nonetheless treats the body as a kind of millstone around the
necks of all women that prevents them from readily attaining a life of
freedom. The needs of the species weigh heaviest on women in Beauvoir's
assessment.
Moi reminds, though, that Beauvoir was writing in the 1940s when
patriarchal double standards relating to women's daily lives were at
their peak, so her somewhat grim view of things perhaps holds true to
the actual lived conditions of women's lives then. Facing up to these
double standards is what enables women (rather than men) to live
authentic lives. As Moi argues, women who read Beauvoir in the 1950s
when *The Second Sex* was practically the only book available that spoke
about women's oppression, found it courageous and inspiring. [[Friedan, Betty]], among others,
wrote at the time that reading *The Second Sex* changed her life.
Beauvoir did not see herself primarily as a philosopher, even though she
had trained in and excelled at philosophy. Rather, what she wanted to
write was fiction, but her first efforts were not very successful. It
was not until she adopted a more autobiographical approach that her work
struck a resonant chord. She became one of the most important
chroniclers of her generation with works such as *L'Invitée* (1943),
translated as *She Came to Stay* (1984), and *Mémoires d'une jeune fille
rangée* (1958), translated as *Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter* (1987),
which captured well the difficult situation of women in the middle of
the tumultuous twentieth century.
Throughout her life, Beauvoir was an active and 'engaged' (to use the
term Sartre would make famous) intellectual. She was on the editorial
board of *Les Temps modernes*, which since its founding has been one of
the most important intellectual organs in France, providing a strong
counter-hegemonic perspective.
