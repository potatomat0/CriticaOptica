[[biological determinism]]

 The
now largely discredited notion that it is biology, specifically the
instincts, that shape the relations between sexes and, more
particularly, defines their respective social roles. Typically, this
viewpoint would hold that because women are the childbearing sex they
are naturally more 'caring' and more inclined to want to stay at home
and nurture children than men. The extension of this idea is that
biology is itself a destiny, for example that women are destined to have
children and that shapes their lives. Understandably, feminists have
rejected this viewpoint, arguing instead that men and women are
culturally conditioned to accept the traditional gender roles as normal.
The first sustained attack on this position came from Mary
Wollstonecraft's *A Vindication of the Rights of Women* (1792).
