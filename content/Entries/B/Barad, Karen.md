[[Barad, Karen]]
 (1956--)


American feminist physicist and philosopher. Her work has been
instrumental to the development of [[new materialism]]. Barad trained
in physics, but moved towards a more interdisciplinary approach,
combining science and humanities. She has written numerous articles
across physics, philosophy, science studies, poststructuralist theory,
and feminist theory, and is best known for *Meeting the Universe
Halfway* (2007). This book puts forth her theory of agential realism, an
[[ontology]] that refuses the
representational split between object and observer and argues that we
cannot think of phenomena as consisting of objects as discrete entities
with inherent boundaries and properties. Rather, following the work of
Niels Bohr, who won a Nobel Prize for his discoveries in quantum
physics, Barad argues that phenomena are inseparable intra-acting
(Barad's term) agencies. The concept of intra-action requires a
conceptual shift from thinking about pre-existing objects relating to
one another to a model of relations that function with pre-existing
relata. The relata (i.e. entities that relate to one another) emerge in
the intra-active process.
Following from this insight, Barad articulates feminist and queer theory
in terms of an overcoming of the so-called divide between humans and
non-humans. Barad's approach was developed as a way to integrate
feminist and queer theory and disrupt representationalist politics.
While Barad's more recent work has been designated as part of the
material turn within feminist research, she prefers to understand her
own work as modelling diffraction. She argues that the quantum
understanding of diffraction troubles the concept of the dichotomy as an
act of absolute differentiation. Barad's innovative interdisciplinary
research continues to combine physics with philosophy, and she has been
the recipient of several prestigious grants, including from the National
Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
