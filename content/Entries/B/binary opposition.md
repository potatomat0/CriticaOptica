[[binary opposition]]

 A pair of
terms that although opposed to one another are necessarily bound
together as each other's condition of possibility. Common examples of
binary oppositions include: male/female, nature/culture, hot/cold,
gay/straight, signifier/signified and so on.
[[structuralism]] is
predicated on binary oppositions to the extent that its basic account of
meaning is that something means what it does by virtue of what it does
not mean.
[[post-structuralism]], and
more especially,
[[deconstruction]], arose as
a challenge to the absolute nature of these oppositions.
