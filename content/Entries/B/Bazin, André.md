[[Bazin, André]] 
(1918--58)


French film critic, co-founder and editor of the highly influential
journal *Cahiers du cinéma*, the key organ of [[auteur theory]]. His essays,
published posthumously in a four-volume set entitled *Qu'est-ce que le
cinema?* (1958--62), translated as *What is Cinema?* (1967--71) were a
major influence on the young [[Nouvelle Vague]] directors. Bazin was
one of the first critics to write about cinema as a specific kind of art
form and though some of his ideas have dated, he nonetheless deserves
credit as one of the founders of the field of film studies. Bazin
constantly sought to determine what is possible in cinema. He was one of
the first to appreciate the possibilities of montage. He was also a
great classifier of films and was always ready to invent a new genre to
accommodate a new kind of film. Cinema, Bazin famously said, is an art
of the real. Not because of its subject matter, however, but rather
because the aesthetic space it creates is one that commands our
credulity. We believe in what we see on the screen, even if we don't
believe what we see is factual or truthful, because we believe in the
objectivity of the mechanical recording device used to create it.
