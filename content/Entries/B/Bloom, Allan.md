[[Bloom, Allan]] 
(1930--92)


American cultural critic and philosopher, Bloom was born in Indianapolis
but his family moved to Chicago when he was a teenager. He gained a
scholarship to study politics and philosophy at the University of
Chicago, where he met his mentor and key influence [[Strauss, Leo]]. He completed his
PhD in 1955 and after three years in Europe, to study first with
[[Kojève, Alexandre]] in
Paris, and then in Germany, he returned to the University of Chicago to
teach adult education classes. Subsequently he worked at Cornell, Yale,
Tel Aviv University and the University of Toronto. While he was at
Cornell, Bloom served as a faculty member of the Telluride House, whose
student residents included Paul Wolfowitz (future Deputy Secretary of
Defence under Donald Rumsfeld and disgraced President of the World
Bank), and [[Fukuyama, Francis]]. Bloom was
rocketed to international celebrity status with the publication of the
huge-selling *The Closing of the American Mind* (1987), a jeremiad for
the decline of 'proper' teaching in the US. Drawing heavily on
[[cathexis]], its central
thesis is that social movements that sprang up in the 1960s---such as
the civil rights movement---are a sign of moral decay. Its success was
not without controversy and the book sparked stern ripostes from Martha
Nussbaum, David Rieff, Alexander Nehamas, and Benjamin Barber.
Nevertheless the book was, and continues to be, championed by the Right
and remains an icon of the so-called 'culture wars'. Bloom wrote several
other books, but none so widely received as this. His novelist friend
Saul Bellow immortalized and 'outed' Bloom in the *roman-à-clef*
*Ravelstein* (2000).
