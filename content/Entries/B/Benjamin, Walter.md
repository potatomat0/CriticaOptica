[[Benjamin, Walter]]
(1892--1940) German cultural critic and essayist, best known for his
account of the impact of new technology on aesthetics. Born to a genteel
and reasonably well-to-do Jewish merchant family in Berlin, Benjamin
grew up in Charlottenburg and Grünewald, which at that time were outside
the city limits of Berlin. Although Jewish, his family were not
especially observant. Benjamin took an interest in
[[messianism]] in later life,
but he never developed an affinity for Judaism or Zionism, much to the
distress of friends like Gershom Scholem who tried to persuade him to
relocate to Israel.
His undergraduate career, like much of his life, was peripatetic. He did
two years of an undergraduate degree in philology at the Albert Ludwig
University in Freiburg (where his fellow students included [[Heidegger, Martin]]), but did not
find the city congenial and returned to Berlin to continue his studies
at the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University (where he attended lectures by
[[Simmel, Georg]]). Exempted
from military service when war broke out in 1914 because of extreme
short-sightedness, Benjamin moved again and completed his philosophy
degree in Munich, where he studied with Heinrich Wölfflin (though he
found his seminars oppressive) and met the great German poet Rainer
Maria Rilke.
In 1916 he moved to Switzerland and completed his doctorate at the
University of Berne, where he met [[Bloch, Ernst]]. Thereafter he
returned to Germany, but his career did not progress smoothly from
doctorate to habilitation, the prerequisite to a professorial
appointment. Indeed, his thesis, *Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels*
(1928), translated as *The Origin of German Tragic Drama* (1977), which
sought to explain in allegorical terms the type of drama known as
Trauerspiel (mourning play), popular in Germany in the early part of the
Baroque period (i.e. the sixteenth century). Central to Benjamin's work
is the claim that Trauerspiel is of a different order from tragedy, with
which it is generally compared, because it is rooted in history rather
than myth. Unfortunately for Benjamin, his examiners at the University
of Frankfurt were not persuaded by this claim and his thesis was failed
in 1925, effectively destroying his chances of an academic career.
Of necessity, he took to freelance writing as a means of supporting
himself and though he never ceased to think about academic subjects, he
never wrote another strictly academic book. Predominantly he wrote book
and theatre reviews for *Frankfurter Zeitung* (at the invitation of
[[Kracauer, Siegfried]]) and
*Literarische Welt* (at the invitation of Hugo von Hofmannsthal). Living
and working in Frankfurt, Benjamin maintained a peripheral but
significant relation with key members of the [[Frankfurt School]], particularly
[[Adorno, Theodor]], with whom
he sustained an important and longstanding correspondence. He travelled
to Moscow in this period and wrote a highly sympathetic journal
recording his experience there.
More typical of his new style was *Einbahnstrasse* (1928), translated as
*One-Way Street* (1978), an enchanting collection of travel vignettes
and street-level observations published in the same year as the book on
Trauerspiel. In 1929 he began writing for radio as well. In the same
year Asja Lacis, whom he had met on Capri a few years earlier,
introduced him to [[Brecht, Bertolt]], who was to have a
significant influence on him. He would later write a series of essays on
Brecht that were put together and posthumously published as *Versuche über Brecht* (1966), translated as *Understanding Brecht* (1973).
Benjamin was also engaged in a long-term translation project at this
time as well; he was part of a small team producing a German version of
Proust's magnum opus, *Á la recherche du temps perdu*.
The next ten years were very productive for Benjamin, in spite of the
enormous turmoil in his life. He began work on, but didn't complete (the
posthumously published) *Das Passagen-Werk* (1982), translated as *The Arcades Project* (1999), an enormous compilation of images and
quotations relating to Paris in the nineteenth century. He also
completed a series of essays on Baudelaire that were intended to preface
this project, which developed Baudelaire's idea of the
[[flâneur]] as a sociological
icon of the nineteenth century. In 1936 he published what is probably
his most famous essay, 'Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen
Reproduzierbarkeit' (1936), translated as 'The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction' (1968), proposing that art in the modern age
lacks the [[aura]] of
previous eras.
As a Jew, his life was made very difficult by the rise of fascism in
Germany and like many of his [[Frankfurt School]] colleagues he was
forced into exile, though sadly he ultimately acted too late. He left
Germany in 1933, but didn't try to get out of Europe until 1940, by
which time France had already fallen. He managed to get as far as the
border town of Port Bou, where he died of a morphine overdose, whether
accidentally or intentionally isn't known. His posthumous reputation,
particularly in the Anglophone world, was assured by the collection
entitled *Illuminations* (1968), edited and introduced by [[Arendt, Hannah]]. It was further
enhanced by [[Eagleton, Terry]]'s short book,
*Walter Benjamin: or, Towards a Revolutionary Criticism* (1981),
written, as he says, to get to Benjamin before his enemies did. Eagleton
highlights Benjamin's technique of reading history 'against the grain'
as a strategy for doing critical theory in the age of
[[postmodernity]].
