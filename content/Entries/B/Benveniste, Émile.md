[[Benveniste, Émile]]
(1902--76) French linguist, generally regarded as one of the main
precursors to
[[structuralism]]. Born in
Aleppo in Northern Syria, then a French Mandate, Benveniste's family,
who were Sephardic Jews, sent him to Marseilles to attend rabbinical
school, but one of the scholars there, recognizing his talent, suggested
he go to the Sorbonne instead to study Indo-European linguistic forms
under Antoine Meillet (a former student of [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]]). The connection
proved fortuitous and Benveniste flourished. His early work was highly
specialist and for that reason little known outside the closed circles
of linguistics, but it was distinguished enough to see him elevated to a
chair at the Collège de France at the comparatively young age of 35.
Although he worked in the shadows for most of his academic career,
Benveniste was propelled into the spotlight with the publication in 1966
of *Problèmes de linguistique générale*, translated as *Problems in
General Linguistics* (1971). The two doyens of Parisian structuralism,
[[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] and
[[Lacan, Jacques]] recognized
him as an important ally in the development of their projects, thus
encouraging Benveniste to broaden his range of interests and cease to
write exclusively for linguists (who ignored him in any case).
Benveniste's work set him apart from other linguists of his generation
for his willingness to embrace ideas drawn from analytic philosophy at a
time when French thought was dominated by the work of
[[cathexis]] and
[[Heidegger, Martin]], and for his
interest in the
[[problematic]] of the
subject. Benveniste broke once and for all with the idea that language
is a signal system by arguing that bees do not have language because
while a bee can report back to the hive what it has seen, it cannot use
an intermediary to do the reporting on its behalf; language, for
Benveniste, arises only with the possibility of reported speech (a
notion that is central to [[Deleuze, Gilles]]'s theory of
literature). By the same token, if language is not purely a signal
system, then there must be a dimension to it that exceeds the basic
requirements of signalling---a dimension often referred to as the
poetic. In order to grasp this, Benveniste distinguished between the
*énoncé* ([[statement]]) and
the *énonciation* (utterance), or to put it more simply the thing said
and the way it is said. This in turn created a logical paradox that
would prove central to Lacan's reformulation of psychoanalysis, namely
that the 'I' of the statement is not the same as the 'I' of the
utterance, that in effect the 'I' is always an 'other'.
