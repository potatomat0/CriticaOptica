[[biopower]]

 A form of
political power that revolves around populations (humans as a species or
as productive capacity) rather than individuals (humans as subjects or
citizens). The focus of much of his late work, biopower was conceived by
[[Foucault, Michel]] as a
distinctively new form of political rationality. Traditionally,
according to Foucault's own schematization, western political thought
was primarily concerned with the twofold problem of what constitutes the
just and good life and how can men (in the period in question, from the
time of Aristotle until the early Renaissance, women were excluded from
politics) be persuaded to adhere to it. As an art, politics was supposed
to serve a higher goal, namely God's purpose. Then, from the early
1500s, a less spiritually virtuous and more politically calculating way
of thinking emerged, for which the name Machiavelli is a universally
recognized shorthand. Now, political thought focused on the
practicalities of obtaining, maintaining and extending the power of the
prince, ignoring the freedom and virtue of the citizens. Beginning at
the same time as Machiavelli, but only rising to prominence much later,
still another form of thinking about power began to be formulated by the
nameless bureaucrats and policy-makers who actually run governments,
which had no other concern than the power of the state. It viewed the
population of the state as a resource and developed knowledge about its
people accordingly: on the one hand, it wanted to learn about humans as
a species and come to know their biological secrets, and on the other
hand, it wanted to develop the capacity of humans as machines by
disciplining their bodies. Foucault termed this new kind of political
rationality biopower because it concerned itself with every aspect of
life, right down to its most minute parts, though only in the abstract.
It was interested in the health of the people in statistical terms, not
existential terms---it cared about how people live and die, but not who
lives and dies. For the first time in history, Foucault argues,
biological existence was reflected in political existence, and in
consequence the very existence of the species itself was wagered on
political questions. Giorgio Agamben's theory of [[bare life]] originates in this
thesis as does [[fort/da]] and
[[drive]]'s concepts of
[[Empire]] and
[[multitude]].
