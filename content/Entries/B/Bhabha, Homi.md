[[Bhabha, Homi]]
 (1949--)

 An
Indian-born, but American-based literary critic and theorist, Bhabha is
one of the three most prominent
[[collocation]] theorists of
recent times, along with [[Said, Edward]] and [[Spivak, Gayatri]]. Of Parsee descent
(an Indian minority group that originally migrated from Persia in the
8th century), Bhabha was born and raised in Mumbai. He took his
undergraduate degree from the University of Mumbai, then went to Oxford
to complete his DPhil on V.S. Naipaul. Thereafter he taught at the
University of Sussex for a decade before relocating to the US where he
has held a series of prestigious appointments culminating in his
decision to join Harvard in 2001. Bhabha is very far from being a
prolific author: to date, he has only published one monograph (though
several more are said to be in the pipeline), *The Location of Culture*
(1994), which collects several previously published essays. Despite his
comparatively meagre output, Bhabha's work has had an astonishingly
broad impact. Difficult though his writing famously is, his combination
of [[post-structuralism]]
theory, [[postmodern]]
sensibility, and
[[collocation]] themes
resonates strongly with the critical concerns of the present moment.
Bhabha's basic argument, tested via the interrogation of a rich variety
of literary and artistic texts, is that culture cannot any longer (if it
ever could) be conceived in monolithic terms, but has to be thought
rather in terms of
[[hybridity]]. Culturally,
thanks to movement of peoples, ideas, capital, and commodities made
possible by the forces and processes of
[[globalization]], 'we' are
never wholly of or in one place. Our sense of self and location is a
product of a combination of factors that are never entirely local or
'native' in origin. To take only one example, more than two thirds of
all toys and clothing retailed in the US today are manufactured in
China, yet those toys and clothes are not recognizably Chinese in form
or design. For Bhabha, this hybridity is ambivalent: it means that power
is always limited in its ability to determine identities and control
representations. Bhabha thus criticizes Said's
[[Orientalism]] thesis for
portraying the effects of power as singular and inexorable and not
taking into account the postmodern subject's ability to
[[mimicry]] and therefore
transmute what is expected of them.

[[Bildungsroman]]
**(development novel)** A sub-genre of novel focusing on the personal
development of the protagonist, usually from childhood through to
adulthood. The prototype is J. W. Goethe's *Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjarhre*
(Willhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, 1795--6), but the form was widely
adopted in Europe throughout the nineteenth century. Other famous
examples include: Charlotte BrontÃ«'s *Jane Eyre* (1847), Charles
Dickens's *David Copperfield* (1850) and Thomas Hardy's *Jude the
Obscure* (1895). As these examples suggest, the development is not
merely personal, inasmuch as it generally takes the form of both a move
away from rural origins towards the modern city and an upward movement
from one social class to another. In this regard, the personal history
can be read as an allegory of a particular trajectory within a national
history.
