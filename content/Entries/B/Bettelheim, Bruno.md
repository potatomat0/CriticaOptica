[[Bettelheim, Bruno]]
(1903--90) Viennese-born, American-based
[[psychoanalysis]] best known
for his (not uncontroversial) work on autism. Born in Vienna, Bettelheim
studied philosophy and art history (which included a compulsory
psychology component) at the University of Vienna. His studies were
twice interrupted, first because of his father's death and the necessity
of taking over the family business, and second because of Austria's
*Anschluss* with Nazi Germany in 1938. Although raised in a secular
family, Bettelheim's Jewish ancestry meant that he was incarcerated by
the Nazis in concentration camps at Dachau and Buchenwald. Fortunately,
he was amnestied after eleven months in April 1939, and was able to make
his way to the US as a refugee. He wrote a moving, bestselling memoir of
this experience, *The Informed Heart* (1960), which used psychoanalysis
to try to understand the behaviour of both guards and inmates. He
eventually settled in Chicago where he was appointed professor of
psychology at the University of Chicago and made the director of the
Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School. It was as director of the Orthogenic
School that Bettelheim made his mark. Established as a treatment
facility for psychologically disturbed children, it enabled him to
develop his theories in a practical setting. In 1967 he published a
series of case studies of autistic children, all of them residents in
his facility, *The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the
Self*, which sold very well and became a highly influential text.
Unfortunately, its central thesis that bad parenting is to blame for
autism (since disproved) had a terrible effect on parents struggling to
raise autistic children. The same work has also been praised by [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]] for not reducing
children's psychological problems to a failure to adequately deal with
their [[Oedipus complex]].
Probably his most lastingly important book is *The Uses of Enchantment*
(1976), which is a psychoanalytic reading of fairy tales. Interestingly,
Bettelheim is highly critical of Disney's rendering of fairy tales like
Snow White and Cinderella for the way they edit out the violence of the
originals. Without exposure to that violence, Bettelheim argues,
children do not learn about the realities of life and aren't given the
opportunity to psychologically prepare themselves for the traumas of
loss they inevitably must face as they grow older. Bettelheim's legacy
is uneven because while some of his theories, particularly those
relating to the genesis of autism, have now been discredited, many of
his other insights remain as cogent as ever.
