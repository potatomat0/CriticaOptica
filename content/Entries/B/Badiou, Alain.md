[[Badiou, Alain]]
 (1937--)


French Marxist philosopher, novelist and playwright. Born in Rabat,
Morocco, Badiou completed high school in Toulouse before moving to Paris
for undergraduate studies at the prestigious
École Normale
Supérieure ([[ANT]]), where he
worked closely with [[Althusser, Louis]], but was never
one of the select group of disciples who came to be known as
Althusserians. After completing his obligatory military service, Badiou
taught in Reims, first at a lycée, then at the university. In 1968 he
was invited by Michel Foucault to join the department of philosophy at
Vincennes (University of Paris VIII), where his colleagues included
[[Cixous, Hélène]], [[Deleuze, Gilles]], and
[[Lyotard, Jean-François]].
After spending thirty years at Vincennes, Badiou left in 1998 to return
to his alma mater ENS.
Badiou is an austere, uncompromising thinker of great originality and
range, whose magnum opus *L'Ětre et l'événement* (1988), translated as
*Being and Event* (2005), is premised on the conviction that mathematics
is an ontology---his conception of being is non-representational, but
schematic: it presents structures of situations, with a view towards
identifying what he calls evental sites, i.e. places where a political
praxis might develop. Badiou's philosophy is primarily interested in the
event, which for him is a moment of rupture in history's continuum, a
shift in the very condition of things after which there is no turning
back. Very few so-called events satisfy this condition in Badiou's eyes
and, by the same token, history has overlooked several events it lacked
the conceptual model to see. A reader-friendly example of how this
notion of philosophy works in relation to history can be found in *Le Siècle* (2005), translated as *The Century* (2007).
Badiou's model of praxis is usually described as subtractive because it
operates on the premise that political action can only work if it
subtracts itself from the power and processes of the state. [[Žižek, Slavoj]] adopts this model in
his self-styled political manifesto *In Defence of Lost Causes* (2008).
Throughout his career, Badiou has been actively involved in politics.
During the events of [[May ’68]] he was a member of
highly vocal Maoist groups. In more recent times he has been involved
with L'Organisation Politique, a politicized group he helped found.
Because of its powerfully political texture, Badiou's philosophy is
increasingly widely read today, a measure both of the volatility of the
times and the lucidity of his thought.
