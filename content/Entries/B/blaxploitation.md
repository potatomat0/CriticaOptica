[[blaxploitation]]

 (neologism
constructed from black exploitation) A sub-genre of Hollywood films
produced in the USA in the 1970s with the deliberate aim of attracting
an African-American audience. Capitalizing on the success of *Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song* (director Van Peebles, 1971), *Shaft*
(director Parks Snr 1971) and *Superfly* (director Parks Jnr 1972),
blaxploitation's aesthetic emulated their gritty storylines and
streetwise heroes and created a new type of film which challenged
Hollywood's stereotypes of black people. Blaxploitation storylines
generally revolved around black men and women winning one over the white
system. In doing so it brought black actors into the foreground of the
narrative action in a way not previously seen in Hollywood, which tended
to consign them to the role of victim or servant. Some 40 movies were
produced in this mould, including pastiches of horror films and
westerns, before the market was saturated and the genre burnt out in the
late 1970s. Quentin Tarantino's (1998) *Jackie Brown* is a homage to the
genre and features one of its greatest stars, Pam Grier.
