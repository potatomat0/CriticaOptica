[[Barthes, Roland]] 
(1915--80)


French literary and cultural critic and leading light of both the
[[structuralism]] and
[[post-structuralism]]
movements. His career was slow-moving to begin with, but at his death he
was one of the most influential intellectuals in the world.
Born in Cherbourg, in north-west France, in lowly circumstances (his
father was a naval officer and his mother a homemaker) Barthes grew up
in Bayonne, near the Spanish border. His childhood was uneventful and he
would later remember it as punctuated by prolonged and intense periods
of boredom. In 1924 he moved to Paris, going to school at the Lycée
Montaigne in the sixth arrondissement behind the Luxembourg Gardens
until he was 14 and then the Lycée Louis-le-Grand near the Sorbonne. In
1934 Barthes contracted tuberculosis, which required his removal to a
mountain sanatorium, severely interrupting his academic career for the
next ten years. Exempted from military service because of his illness,
he spent the Second World War---when not in a sanatorium---working as a
secondary school teacher, first in Biarritz, then in Paris.
After the war Maurice Nadeau invited Barthes to contribute to the
cultural pages of the prestigious underground publication *Combat*,
founded by the Resistance and edited by an illustrious team of authors
that included Albert Camus and [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]. The essays Barthes
submitted, which dealt with the ethico-political responsibility of
writers, would become his first book *Le Degré zéro de l'écriture*
(1953), translated as *Writing Degree Zero* (1967). Although this book
spoke in favour of a politically engaged form of writing of the kind
Sartre advocated (*littérature engagée* or committed writing), Barthes
rarely if ever involved himself directly in political struggles. Indeed,
in 1960 he fell out with his friend Nadeau because he refused to put his
name to the 'Manifesto of the 121' declaring the right of
insubordination in response to the Algerian War. Again in [[May ’68]], Barthes kept his
distance from the events of the student protest. Similarly in 1971 he
joined neither the [*Groupe d'Information sur les
Prisons](#X1eb5293701d7399d678f35ee22fea61f1e1dea8) (Group for
Information on Prisons) nor the *Front Homosexuel d'Action
Révolutionnaire* (Homosexual Revolutionary Action).
Barthes career path was chequered to say the least. Before he took his
first academic job in the sixth section of the École Pratique des Hautes
Études in 1960 (at the advanced age of 45), he worked for a number of
years in the French Foreign Office. His first posting was to the French
Institute in Romania, where he gave lectures on popular culture,
developing the style he would perfect with *Mythologies* (1957),
translated as *Mythologies* (1972). When the Romanian authorities
decided to expel the Institute in 1949, Barthes was reassigned to
Alexandria in Egypt, where he spent a great deal of his free time with
the semiotician [[Greimas, Algirdas Julien]] who introduced him
to the work of [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]]. In 1950 he
returned to Paris, still without an academic job. He soon quit his job
at the Foreign Office, finding it unbearably tedious, choosing instead
to make ends meet by combining a series of untenured research assistant
posts with cultural journalism.
In 1953, again at the invitation of Maurice Nadeau, Barthes started
writing a monthly column for the newly-established cultural journal,
*Les Lettres nouvelles*. These essays looked through a critical lens at
the minutiae of [[everyday life]] in all its banality,
covering everything from soap bubbles, to striptease and pasta
advertisements. When these essays were collected and published in book
form as *Mythologies* in 1957 they were an immediate sensation. In this
period, Barthes also contributed reviews to *Théâtre populaire*. The
work of [[Other]]'s Berliner
Ensemble, which regularly brought its productions to Paris, made a
particularly big impression on Barthes. According to [[Jameson, Fredric]], Brecht's
influence can readily be seen in *Mythologies*, which in his view is a
profound instance of the
[[estrangement-effect]] at
work. The concept of [[myth]]
that emerged from this work had a significant effect on the development
of [[Cultural Studies]].
In 1958, Barthes asked [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]] to supervise
a doctoral dissertation on fashion, but the latter turned him down,
though not without offering the invaluable advice that he should read
Vladimir Propp's *Morfoloógija skázki* (1928), translated as *Morphology of the Folktale* (1958). He eventually found a supervisor in linguist
André Martinet, but never got around to actually finishing his PhD. His
proposed project on fashion was however completed and published as
*Système de la mode* (1967), translated as *The Fashion System* (1985).
In 1963 he met [[Sollers, Philippe]], the flamboyant
novelist and editor of the newly established journal *Tel Quel*, with
which Barthes' name would become inextricably linked in the early 1970s
in spite of the overtly Maoist orientation it adopted.
In 1976, at [[Foucault, Michel]]'s instigation,
Barthes was elected to the chair of literary semiology at the
illustrious Collège de France, an incredible achievement for someone
with such an unorthodox academic pedigree. His final book, written as a
work of mourning for his mother, who died in 1977, *La Chambre claire*
(1980) translated as *Camera Lucida* (1982), was a meditation on
photography, a subject that had interested him his entire life. Now at
the peak of his fame, largely thanks to the bestseller status of his
previous book, the charming semi-autobiographical *Fragments d'un
discourse amoureux* (1977), translated as *A Lover's Discourse* (1979),
Barthes was even interviewed by *Playboy*. Then tragedy struck. On
February 25, 1980, while crossing the road, Barthes was knocked down by
a delivery van. (Laurent Binet has used Barthes' death as the basis of a
mystery novel entitled *The 7th Function of Language*.) He was taken to
the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière and although the doctors did not think
he'd been seriously injured he never regained his health and died a few
weeks later on March 26. *See also* [[readerly| readerly and writerly]], [[work|work and text]].
