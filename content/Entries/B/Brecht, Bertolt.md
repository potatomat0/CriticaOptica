[[Brecht, Bertolt]]
(1898--1956) German Marxist playwright, novelist, poet and theorist. One
of the most influential writers of the twentieth century and arguably
the most important dramatist of his time. His writing displays what
Wolfgang Haug usefully calls 'unity-in-dispersal', which is to say it
ranges across an impressive variety of genres and styles, but at its
core there is a consistent political conviction.
Brecht was born in Augsburg in Southern Germany. His father was the
managing director of a paper mill and solidly middle class. Brecht
enrolled at Munich University in 1917 to study drama, but took on
medical courses as well in the hope of avoiding being drafted into the
army. He was partially successful in this gambit in that while he was
eventually drafted, he was posted to a VD clinic in Augsburg as an
orderly. After the war Brecht launched himself into his theatre career
and was rewarded with early success. His first play, *Baal* (1918), won
the prestigious Kleist Prize. In 1927 he joined the company of Erwin
Piscator, widely regarded as the most important experimental theatre
group in Germany. He borrowed a great deal from Piscator in his own
later experiments in staging.
Considerable wealth and genuine fame soon came his way with his
adaptation of John Gay's *The Beggar's Opera* (1728), *Die Dreigroschenoper* (1928), translated as *The Threepenny Opera* (1933),
which he worked on with composer Kurt Weill. One of the most popular
pieces of musical theatre of the twentieth century, it has been
performed more than 10,000 times and many of its songs, such as 'Mack
the Knife', have become jazz and cabaret standards sung by the likes of
Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone. Two years later Brecht and Weill
collaborated on *Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny* (1930),
translated as *Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny*, a powerful
critique of the rising tide of fascism in Germany.
His anti-Nazi stance would necessitate him leaving Germany when they
came to power in 1933. He fled first to Denmark, where he was joined by
[[Benjamin, Walter]], then to
Sweden and thereafter, like so many of his compatriots, particularly the
[[Frankfurt School]], to the
US. He ended up in Los Angeles, which he famously described as God's way
of economizing by having heaven and hell in the one place. He got work
in Hollywood, despite not being able to speak English, and continued to
write highly political plays, such as *Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder*
(1939), translated as *Mother Courage and her Children* (1941), *Leben des Galilei* (1943), translated as *Life of Galileo* (1947), and *Der gute Mensch von Sezuan* (1943), translated as *The Good Person of
Szechuan* (1948). Politics for Brecht---at least in his theatre---means
two things: on the one hand, there is the pleasure (but also the pain)
of the acquisition of knowledge, while on the other hand, there is the
torment of the impossible situation in which no 'right' decision can be
made.
Brecht remained in the US until 1947, the year he was called before the
House Un-American Activities Committee to account for his communist
links. He was quickly blacklisted in Hollywood as a result, effectively
making it impossible for him to continue working in the US. He returned
to Europe, first to Switzerland, then to East Germany, where the
Communist Government gave him his own theatre company, the soon-to-be
world-renowned Berliner Ensemble, which continues to perform his works
today, and his own theatre, The Theatre am Schiffbauerdamm, where *The Threepenny Opera* premiered. In his last years, Brecht wrote
comparatively little, concentrating instead on directing his plays,
which he toured to several European capitals, including Paris, where the
young [[Barthes, Roland]] was
captivated.
Brecht is important to critical theory because he sought to make the
theatre into a vehicle for political debate and in this regard he
responded forcefully (perhaps more so than any other artist of the
twentieth century) to the challenge of creating an aesthetics that is
neither simply art for art's sake nor pure agitprop. His name is
synonymous with [[Epic Theatre]], a method of staging
he devised over a number of years with the goal of making performances
more intellectual. He famously said that theatre ought to be viewed with
the same detachment and disinterested judgement as that with which
boxing enthusiasts view fights. To achieve this
[[estrangement-effect]], as
he called it, Brecht staged things so as to thwart the feeling of
empathy audiences 'naturally' feel for what they see on stage.
Technically this was achieved in a number of ways: actors were
instructed to break out of their roles and comment on their characters,
or else intertitles might be dropped from the ceiling narrating the
action ahead of time so as to diminish suspense.
