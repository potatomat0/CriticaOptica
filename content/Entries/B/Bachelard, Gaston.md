[[Bachelard, Gaston]]
(1884--1962) French philosopher of science. Born in Bar-sur-Aube, in the
Champagne region of France, Bachelard's academic career was very slow to
start. He spent several years working in a post office before even
commencing university study. And it was not until after the First World
War, in which he served with distinction (earning the Croix de Guerre),
that he finally attained an academic post. His first job was a professor
of physics and chemistry at a College in Bar-sur-Aube. He remained there
from 1919 until 1930, during which time he began to focus more and more
on the philosophy of science. And it was in this area that he eventually
made his mark, becoming professor of the philosophy of science at the
Sorbonne in 1940. There are two main trajectories in Bachelard's work,
reflecting his conviction that there are two types of thought:
scientific and poetic. With respect to science, Bachelard was one of the
first thinkers to emphasize discontinuity in the history of thought.
Knowledge does not progress according to a logical, linear set of steps
moving from partial to complete understanding; rather it progresses
unevenly from one misconception to another until understanding is
finally attained. On this view, the previous attempts at understanding a
particular phenomenon cannot be used as a reliable guide as to how
knowledge was attained in the final instance. Bachelard introduced the
concept of the [[epistemological break]] to characterize the
gap between past ignorance and present understanding. This concept was
widely influential and was developed further by [[Canguilhem, Georges]] (in his account
of medical science) and [[Foucault, Michel]] (in his histories
of the clinic, prison, and madness). It also had enormous impact on
[[Althusser, Louis]], who used
it to articulate his claim that
[[Marxism]] broke with both
[[genre]] and Feuerbach. The
other trajectory in Bachelard's work, reflecting strongly the influence
of [[Jung, Carl]], concerns
the poetic image, which for Bachelard is not the same thing as a
metaphor. It is rather an opening toward the future. In a series of
studies on elemental themes---air, water, fire, and space---Bachelard
produced a powerful account of the daydream or reverie, arguing that it
enables us to get in touch with the deeper reserves of our imagination.
The best known of these studies is *La Poétique de l'espace* (1958)
translated as *The Poetics of Space* (1964), which was a worldwide
bestseller. Other books in the series include: *La psychanalyse du feu*
(1938) translated as *The Psychoanalysis of Fire* (1977); *L'Eau et les
rêves* (*1942*) translated as *Water and Dreams: An Essay on the
Imagination of Matter* (1994); and *La Poétique de la rêverie* (1960)
translated as *The Poetics of Reverie: Childhood, Language, and the
Cosmos* (1992).
