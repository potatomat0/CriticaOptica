[[Baudrillard, Jean]]
(1929--2007) French cultural critic and semiotician. Born in Reims,
Baudrillard developed an early interest in German language and culture.
He taught German at secondary-school level from 1956--66, and translated
plays by the German authors [[Brecht, Bertolt]] and [[Weiss, Peter]], while undertaking
his university education at Paris X--Nanterre. He completed his doctoral
thesis in 1966 and it was published two years later as *Le Système des
objets* (1968), translated as *The System of Objects* (1996). This was
followed in quick succession by *La Société de consummation* (1970),
translated as *The Consumer Society* (1998); *Pour une critique de
l'economie politique du signe* (1972), translated as *For a Critique of
the Political Economy of the Sign* (1981); and *Le Miroir de la
production* (1973), translated as *The Mirror of Production* (1975).
These three books not only established Baudrillard as one of the most
significant thinkers of the second half of the twentieth century, they
also helped initiate the global re-evaluation of the state of society in
the era of [[late capitalism]] that would
subsequently be known as
[[postmodernism]].
While Baudrillard himself rejected the term postmodernism, his work has
always been---however unjustly---associated with that concept because
the main thrust of his writing is congruent with its
[[anti-foundationalism]]
impulse. He has also been described as a post-Marxist because although
his work contains many quite powerful critiques of Marx, it is neither
anti-Marx nor right-wing. More recently critics have pointed up his
debts to [[Situationism]] and
Alfred Jarry's
[[’pataphysics]] as a means
of sidestepping debates about his politics, arguing that his goal was
always to provoke thought rather than propound a particular doctrine. On
balance, there is probably no need to choose between these
classifications since each is partly true.
Baudrillard's theory, which took shape in his very first publication and
was maintained throughout his life, combines [[Bataille, Georges]]'s theory of the
sacred and Freudian
[[psychoanalysis]] and
applies it to the contemporary
[[situation]]. What
Baudrillard refers to as the real is in effect the equivalent of what
Bataille calls the sacred, it is that which serves as the ultimate
anchor and support of meaning. Secularization effectively destroys this
point of reference with the result that meaning becomes unmoored and
'free-floating'. To compensate, contemporary society has constructed
numerous simulacra of the sacred, such as the media, which
superficially, and in a highly artificial manner, serve the purpose of
grounding meaning. But of course the manifold simulations of the real
which western society has conjured can never truly replace the sacred so
for all intents and purposes the real has disappeared. Baudrillard's
argument is not that there is no reality any more as he has sometimes
been taken to mean. It is rather that there is nothing that can
guarantee the meaning of reality.
What is of particular interest in Baudrillard's work, then, is his
explanation of how we cope with the loss of the real. Baudrillard
developed an elaborate system of symbolic meaning that seeks to account
for the apparent addiction western society has for commodities. Instead
of simply blaming this on a deterioration of national character as
conservative cultural critics like [[Bloom, Allan]] did in *The Closing
of the American Mind* (1987) and Christopher Lasch did in *The Culture
of Narcissism* (1979), Baudrillard argues that consumption is the new
form of the sacred. But a sacralized commodity is also a dematerialized
commodity because its value is no longer intrinsic, but attaches to it
as a function of belief. Consequently, our longing for a commodity
object is, symbolically speaking, more important to us than its actual
possession. In effect, no matter what we have it is bound to be a
disappointment, and it is this paradox that according to Baudrillard
drives western culture.
In the 1970s and 1980s he travelled extensively and wrote several
aphoristic and elegiac books observing in minute and often hilarious
detail the diverse manifestations of this paradox, which he aptly termed
the 'impossible exchange', e.g. *Cool Memories* vols I--V (1987--2007),
*America* (1988), and *The Transparency of Evil* (1993).
Unconventional in his outlook and always willing to be controversial as
well, Baudrillard attained true notoriety in 1991 when he pronounced
that the Gulf War would not take place despite the fact that the UN
Security Council had already authorized the use of force. Then, after
the invasion had already commenced, he asked if the war was actually
taking place. And finally, after the hostilities were over, he
questioned whether the Gulf War had in fact taken place. First published
in a series of articles for the French journal *Libération* and shortly
thereafter published in book form as *La Guerre du Golfe n'a pas eu
lieu* (1991), translated as *The Gulf War did not take Place* (1995),
these essays were for many the height of postmodern folly. Given that
the whole world had been able to watch the war live on CNN,
Baudrillard's questioning of it seemed to defy sense and it provoked
more than a few sceptical commentators to write him off as a crank (e.g.
Christopher Norris's *Uncritical Theory: Postmodernism, Intellectuals
and the Gulf War* (1992). However, this book is consistent with much
that others regard as positive in Baudrillard's work inasmuch that it
questions the truth of appearances. Baudrillard did not deny that the US
had sent a ground assault force into Kuwait and Iraq, but he did
question whether the use of overwhelming force against a much weaker
opponent could be called a war. *See also* [consumer
