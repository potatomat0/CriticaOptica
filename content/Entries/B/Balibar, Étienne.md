[[Balibar, Étienne]]
 (1942--)


French [[Marxism]]
philosopher and social theorist. Born in Bourgogne, Balibar studied at
the École Normale Supérieure, where he met [[Althusser, Louis]], who became his
mentor. Balibar rose to prominence as an 'Althusserian', one of a select
group of Althusser's students and colleagues, that included [[Macherey, Pierre]], [[Pêcheux, Michel]], [[Poulantzas, Nicos]], and [[Rancière, Jacques]], among others,
who worked together to advance Althusser's structuralist rewriting of
Marxist doctrine. Balibar collaborated with Althusser, Macherey and
Rancière to write *Lire le capital* (1968), partially translated as
*Reading Capital* (1970), which is a close reading of several key
sections of [[Marx, Karl]]'s
*Das Kapital*. Although Balibar's contribution to this work tends to be
conflated with Althusser's (Macherey and Rancière have fared much worse
as their contributions were deleted from subsequent editions and are not
even included in the original English translation), it is significant
for the way it lays out the basic principles of [[historical materialism]], formulating it
as a general theory of social formations. In the 1970s, when Marxism
came under increasingly heavy attack because of the revelations about
the existence of Gulags in the USSR, Balibar did not renounce Marxism
altogether, but he did quit the Communist Party, of which he had been a
member for some twenty years. In the 1980s and 1990s, still working
within a Marxist framework, but now outside of the shadow of Althusser,
Balibar turned to more 'practical' questions, such as the problems posed
by the transformation of nations under the aegis of global capitalism
and the continuing problems of racism. In a book co-written with
Immanuel Wallerstein, *Race, nation, classe: les identités ambiguës*
(1988), translated as *Race, Nation, Class: Ambiguous Identities*
(1991), Balibar proposes the concept of
[[neo-racism]] to explain the
perpetuation of this phenomenon in the postcolonial era. More recently,
his thoughts have turned to the problem of the emergence and development
of the European Union: *Nous, citoyens d'Europe? Les Frontiers, l'État,
le people* (2001), translated as *We, the People of Europe? Reflections
on Transnational Citizenship* (2004), and *Europe, Constitution,
Frontière* (2005).
