[[Blanchot, Maurice]]
(1907--2003) French philosopher and author, Blanchot is a major figure
in twentieth-century French intellectual history, but one whose presence
is often and perhaps deliberately hard to detect. Consistent with his
view that literary and philosophical works are not reducible to either a
psychological or sociological explanation, Blanchot was in his last
years famously reclusive in his habits. His prose style is similarly
enigmatic---in his fiction he habitually erases the markers of place and
person readers rely on to coordinate their understanding of the text;
and his philosophy, concerned as it is with the unsayable (death,
silence, and solitude are among his key preoccupations, the others being
friendship, work, and space), constantly strives to say that which, it
acknowledges, can only be gestured towards.
Blanchot was born in Quain in the Saône-et-Loire district of Burgundy.
He did his undergraduate degree at the University of Strasbourg,
studying German and philosophy. There he met [[Levinas, Emmanuel]], who would become
a lifelong friend. As an undergraduate Blanchot was actively involved
with the extreme right-wing group Action Française. He wrote articles
for such right-wing publications as *Journal de Débats, Réaction, Le
Rempart, Combat*, and *L'Insurgé*, perhaps explaining his later
reticence with respect to biography. However, following the defeat of
France in 1940 he refused to collaborate with the Vichy regime and
retreated almost completely from public life, not surfacing again until
the [[May ’68]]. He is widely
believed to have authored the famous 'Manifeste de 121', a declaration
signed by 121 intellectuals (mostly from the left) proclaiming the right
of insubordination in protest to the Algerian war.
[[Deleuze, Gilles]], [[de Man, Paul]], [[Derrida, Jacques]] and [[Foucault, Michel]], among many
others, have all paid homage to Blanchot, praising him for articulating
the gap---which Blanchot designated as the Outside---between the sayable
and the non-sayable and more particularly for attempting to say what it
is that belongs only to art. Like his friend [[Bataille, Georges]], Blanchot pursued
this project via the dual pathways of literature and philosophy.
Blanchot's novels, such as *Thomas l'Obscur* (1941), translated as
*Thomas the Obscure* (1973) and *L'Arrêt de mort* (1948), translated as
*The Death Sentence* (1978), are every bit as experimental as
Bataille's, and only slightly less confronting. His best known
philosophical works are: *L'Espace littéraire* (1955), translated as
*The Space of Literature* (1982), and *L'Entretien infini* (1969),
translated as *The Infinite Conversation* (1993).
