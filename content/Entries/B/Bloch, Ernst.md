[[Bloch, Ernst]] 
(1885--1977)


German Marxist philosopher, social critic and utopianist. Bloch was born
in the industrial town of Ludwigshafen. His father was an assimilated
Jew of modest means who worked as an official on the railways. Bloch
studied philosophy in Munich and Würzburg, before making a definitive
move to Berlin where he was mentored by [[Simmel, Georg]] (their friendship
ended when Simmel spoke in favour of Germany's entry to World War I). In
Berlin, Bloch also met and became a firm friend of Marxist literary
critic [[Lukács, György]] with
whom he would later have very public disagreements concerning
[[Expressionism]], which he
favoured and Lukács did not.
At the outbreak of World War 1, Bloch (declared unfit for military
service) moved out of Berlin, first to Grünewald, and then to
Switzerland, where he struck up a friendship with cultural critic
[[Benjamin, Walter]]. After
the war, he returned to Berlin and was part of the large circle of
intellectuals who were resident there in the heady Weimar Republic
days---[[Adorno, Theodor]],
