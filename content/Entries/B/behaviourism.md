[[behaviourism]]

 In psychology,
the methodological conviction that only the body's measurable physical
responses to stimuli can be used to determine the true nature of
psychological states. The most well-known example of this approach is
Pavlov's experiments with dogs, showing that the sound of the dinner
bell was sufficient to stimulate a saliva response. The most prominent
exponent of this form of psychology was B. H. Skinner, who tried to show
that humans act according to experience, rather than intention. The
problem with this account of human behaviour, apart from its obviously
mechanistic modelling, is that it cannot account for human inventions
that cannot have been caused by mere accident. For example, the
malleability of copper wasn't discovered by accidentally dropping copper
ore into a cooking fire because it doesn't melt at that temperature, but
needs superheating, which requires the application of engineering
principles. The same can be said for virtually all cognitive
achievements, they are not explainable as reactions to stimuli.
