[[Butler, Judith]]
 (1956--)


American feminist philosopher and gender theorist, Butler was born in
Cleveland, Ohio. She completed her PhD in the Department of Philosophy
at Yale University in 1984, where she attended seminars by [[de Man, Paul]] and [[Derrida, Jacques]], whose work would
influence her in interesting ways. After holding visiting positions at
Princeton, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins, Butler obtained a permanent
position at the University of California, Berkeley. She is probably the
most widely read and influential gender theorist in the world.
A highly sophisticated work, Butler's PhD, which was published as
*Subjects of Desire: Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth-Century France*
(1987), maps out a clear project that subsequent works would set out to
complete, namely the attempt to understand how social constructs like
[[gender]] come into being
and more especially how they come to be seen as naturally occurring
rather than historical. As Butler points out, while it is possible to
choose a gender one wishes to identify with, it is presently impossible
to choose not to have any gender at all. Society constrains us to have a
gender, whether we want to or not. Her subsequent books, *Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity* (1990) and *Bodies that Matter: On the Discursive Limits of 'Sex'* (1993), try to theorize
this situation in terms of the concept of performativity (which she
adapts from [[Austin, John Langshaw]]'s concept of the
[[performative]]).
In *Gender Trouble*, Butler argues that contrary to popular wisdom both
sex (generally assumed to be a biological 'fact') and gender are
culturally constructed terms and the binary relation between the two is
mutually reinforcing. By refusing this binary relation and showing that
sex is fully as much a cultural construct as gender, Butler opens the
way for a genuine critique of both terms. Both, she subsequently claims,
can be understood in terms of performativity: sex and gender are, she
argues, using Drag Queens as her case in point, the coded constructs
that result from countless performances of gender and sex roles. Drag
Queens turned out to be an unfortunate choice of example for Butler as
many of her readers misunderstood her as saying that ultimately gender
is simply a matter of choice. *Bodies that Matter* corrects this
viewpoint with an extremely rigorous account of the various discursive
ways in which gender is regulated.
Outside of her work on gender theory, Butler identifies herself as an
anti-Zionist Jew and is a stern critic of Israeli politics. Her later
works, especially *Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative*
(1997), *Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence* (2004),
and *Frames of War: When is Life Grievable?* (2009) extend the notion of
performativity to contemporary politics, while *Giving an Account of
Oneself* (2005), basing itself in a critique of [[Levinas, Emmanuel]], offers an ethics
for the contemporary world.
