[[Braudel, Fernand]] 
(1902--85)


French historian, best known as a leading light of the [[Annales School]], and from his
elevation to the Collège de France in 1949 until his death one of the
most influential historians in France.
Born in rural France, Braudel wanted to become a doctor but in
accordance with his father's wishes studied history instead. On
graduation he taught high school history in Algeria for nearly a decade
from 1923 to 1932. He then returned to France to teach in a lycée, where
he met Lucien Febvre, future co-founder of the journal *Annales*. In
1934, along with anthropologist [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]], he was
invited to Brazil to help establish the University of São Paulo. He
remained there until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when
he returned to France to enlist in the army. He was captured by the
Germans in 1940 and spent the remainder of the war in a prison camp.
It was in prison, working from memory, that he wrote the first draft of
his PhD, *La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l'époque de
Philippe II* (1949), translated as *The Mediterranean and the
Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II* (1996), which established
his reputation. Commencing as a study of Spain's Philip II, this massive
book of over 600,000 words soon grew into a dense but marvellous account
of virtually every aspect of life and culture relating to the
Mediterranean in the second half of the sixteenth century. Importantly,
it sketches Braudel's three-level model of history, which would become
the signature of the [[Annales School]]: the first level,
which he termed the [[longue durée]], or 'geo-history', is
the practically imperceptible level of humans' interaction with the
physical environment; the second level refers to the formation of social
groups, from the tribe to the state, incorporating the problem of the
operation of political structures and economies; while the third level
refers to the lives of individuals.
Braudel thus redefined historical time as simultaneously geographical,
social, and individual (he was in this sense, as recent work by Manuel
DeLanda has recognized, a precursor to the development of complexity
models of history). This model was clarified further in Braudel's next
great undertaking, the three-volume *Civilisation matérielle et
capitalisme* (1967--79), translated as *Civilization and Capitalism*
(1981--83). This work was a major influence on [[Wallerstein, Immanuel]], particularly
his concept of [[world-system theory]]. Braudel's approach
to history entailed a paradox: he took great pains to situate
individuals, such as Philip II, in their historical context, only to
demonstrate their relative unimportance when compared to the deeper
historical patterns of society and geography. Despite its aspiration to
a 'total history' of the region, Braudel has been criticized for his
comparative neglect of social values, attitudes and beliefs. His
insistence on the material details of life, right down to soil quality
and climate, has however had a lasting impact on the fields of history
and [[Cultural Studies]].
