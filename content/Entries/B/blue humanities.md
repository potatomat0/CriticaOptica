[[blue humanities]]

 A movement
in literary and cultural studies that, drawing on critical practices and
theoretical approaches from [[New Historicism]] and [[new materialism]], focuses on the
presence of the ocean in cultural texts. As Steve Mentz demonstrates in
his book *At the Bottom of Shakespeare's Ocean* (2009), which is one of
the foundational texts in the field, the ocean and related practices of
ocean-going (including being shipwrecked) are central to a number of
Shakespeare's plays---*The Tempest* is obviously unthinkable in the
absence of the ocean, but so is *Othello*, which also depends upon
sea-faring---but is generally overlooked in the critical literature on
them. Blue humanities is in this respect comparable to [[Said, Edward]]'s notion of
[[contrapuntal reading]]
inasmuch as it seeks to give emphasis to an aspect of the text that is
usually overlooked but can nonetheless be demonstrated to be crucial.
For Mentz, though, it goes beyond that: it is also about re-establishing
a kind of poetics of the ocean, thus re-establishing a humanistic
connection with it.
