[[Bloom, Harold]]
 (1930--)


Jewish American literary theorist and critic best known for his notion
of the [*anxiety of
influence](#X2b8fde86e14daca6dfd51f92d52577bed2f4432). Born in New York,
Bloom grew up in the South Bronx. In 1947 he was admitted to Cornell
University. There he was mentored by M. H. Abrams, a specialist in the
study of romanticism, a subject that Bloom would make his own too. He
graduated from Cornell in 1952, then spent a year at Pembroke College,
Cambridge, before going to Yale to complete his doctoral studies. He
finished his PhD in 1955 and was employed more or less immediately by
Yale and has worked there ever since. Bloom is an incredibly prolific
writer and editor and his range is enormous---he seems to have read
everything of literary significance in seemingly every language. At the
core of his work is the idea that all writers are engaged in a kind of
creative [[field]] struggle
with their literary predecessors. This thesis is spelled out in a short
but highly influential book entitled *The Anxiety of Influence* (1973).
The history of poetry, Bloom argues, is the history of poetic influence.
Strong poets creatively misread their precursors so as to open a poetic
space for their imaginative voice; weak poets, meanwhile, idealize and
imitate, lacking both the courage and the talent to do better. Oscar
Wilde, he says, is just such a failure, because his poetry owes
everything to Coleridge. The strong poet, as Bloom calls them, digests,
or better yet [[sublime]],
their precursor (the exception to this rule is Shakespeare who had
neither a precursor or successor who was his equal). Bloom has been
criticized by [[feminism]]
scholars like Elaine Showalter for his almost entirely masculine view of
literary history; but has equally been an inspiration for feminist
critics like Sandra Gilbert, Susan Gubar, and Camille Paglia. His theory
of inspiration and influence is at the heart of virtually everything
Bloom has written. A champion of an elitist or Olympian view of
literature, Bloom never hesitates to state what he thinks is good or bad
in literature. He was even bold enough to propose a definitive reading
list in his bestseller *The Western Canon: The Books and the School of
the Ages* (1994).
