[[bare life]] **(*nuda vita*)

**
Italian philosopher [[Agamben, Giorgio]]'s concept for life
that has been exposed to what he terms the structure of exception that
constitutes contemporary
[[biopower]]. The term
originates in Agamben's observation that the Ancient Greeks had two
different words for what in contemporary European languages is simply
referred to as 'life': *bios* (the form or manner in which life is
lived) and *zōē* (the biological fact of life). His argument is that the
loss of this distinction obscures the fact that in a political context,
the word 'life' refers more or less exclusively to the biological
dimension or *zōē* and implies no guarantees about the quality of the
life lived. Bare life refers then to a conception of life in which the
sheer biological fact of life is given priority over the way a life is
lived, by which Agamben means its possibilities and potentialities.
Suggestions made in 2008 by Scotland Yard and the Institute for Public
Policy Research in Britain that children as young as five should be DNA
typed and their details placed in a database if they exhibit behavioural
signs indicating future criminal activity is a perfect example of what
Agamben means by bare life. It reduces the prospects of the life of a
particular child to their biology and takes no interest in or account of
the actual circumstances of their life. *See also* [homo
