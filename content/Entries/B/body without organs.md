[[body without organs]]

 A core
concept in [[Deleuze, Gilles]]
and [[Guattari, FÃ©lix]]'s
account of the genesis of the schizophrenic subject. The concept
underwent a number of transformations from its first usage in Deleuze's
*Logique du sens* (1969), translated as *Logic of Sense* (1990) to its
more well-known deployment in *Mille plateaux* (1980) translated as *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987). Interestingly, it fades almost completely
from view in Deleuze's work after his book on Francis Bacon, which was
published immediately after *A Thousand Plateaus*. Guattari tends not to
use the term much in his later works either, but one should certainly
consult his recently published journals in *The Anti-Oedipus Papers*
(2006) for an instructive account of how he used the term in relation to
himself. The phrase 'body without organs' was borrowed from
schizophrenic French playwright and poet [[Artaud, Antonin]], but Artaud's work
taken in isolation cannot be used to explain the concept. Deleuze reads
Artaud in counterpoint to [[Klein, Melanie]] (and to a lesser
extent, Gisela Pankow) and it is only in this context that the term
becomes meaningful. As Deleuze explains in *Logic of Sense*, Klein
proposed that in addition to the anal
[[object]] in
[[psychoanalysis]] there is a
urethral or liquid object, and whereas the former attracts our desire
the latter absorbs it, effectively negating it. Deleuze regards it as a
missed opportunity that Klein did not pursue this idea very far and
adopts it for his own purposes to describe the schizophrenic subject who
feels so persecuted by his or her desire that they decide to renounce
desire altogether and become a body without objects (object and organ
are the same thing in this context). In subsequent work, Deleuze adds a
second function to this concept: when the subject has become a body
without organs, the desire seems to issue from this body as a
'miraculate'.
