[[Balint, Michael]]
(1896--1970) Hungarian psychoanalyst. Born in Budapest, the son of a
Jewish physician, Balint initially studied medicine, but while he was at
university he became interested in the work of [[Freud, Sigmund]] and began attending
the lectures of SÃ¡ndor Ferenczi (at that time Freud's close friend). In
1920 he moved to Berlin to work on a doctorate in biochemistry, but he
kept up his interest in
[[psychoanalysis]]. He
returned to Hungary in 1924, but the political situation there soon
compelled him to leave again and he moved to Britain, where he remained
for the rest of his life. In the UK he became influenced by the work of
Melanie Klein, and is generally regarded as an [[object relations theory]] like her. There,
too, he was able to further his interest in psychoanalysis, eventually
developing it into a full-time practice devoted to marital problems. His
major works are *Primary Love and Psycho-analytic Technique* (1956) and
*Basic Fault* (1967).
