[[Breton, André]] 
(1896--1966)


French writer and poet best known as one of the founders of
[[Surrealism]]. He was the
author of the *Surrealist Manifesto* (1924) and one of the movement's
principal theorists. Because of his outspoken attitude and doctrinal
approach---he frequently 'excommunicated' people from the movement for
not agreeing with his vision of how things should be---Breton was known
as the 'Pope of Surrealism'.
Breton was born in Normandy. His family were not wealthy. He studied
medicine and psychiatry in Paris, but World War I interrupted his
studies and he did not complete his training. During the war he worked
in a neurological ward for soldiers with 'shell-shock' (i.e.
post-traumatic stress syndrome) in a hospital in Nantes. There he began
exploring the potential of
[[psychoanalysis]] to unlock
the creative side of the
[[psyche]]. One of his
patients was an eccentric young writer, Jacques Vaché, whom Breton later
credited as a major influence, describing him as the spiritual son of
[[Jarry, Alfred]].
After the war, Breton returned to Paris and became involved with several
[[Dada]] artists and writers.
In 1919 he co-founded the journal *Littérature* with Louis Aragon and
Philippe Soupault. Breton and Soupault were particularly interested in a
procedure they called automatic writing which, inspired by [[Freud, Sigmund]]'s notion of [[free association]], they thought
would provide a window into the operations of the
[[unconscious]]. Together
they published a novel utilising this method, *Les Champs magnétiques*
(1920), translated as *The Magnetic Fields* (1985)---almost
incomprehensible by traditional standards of writing, this novel
signalled a departure from Dada because it was active rather than
reactive. It proved highly influential and soon a great number of
artists began experimenting with this technique, including visual
artists like André Masson and musicians like Edgard Varèse.
In 1924 Breton published the first of three manifestos for Surrealism,
which served to define the movement as a revolution in the arts. Breton
joined the Communist Party in 1927, but was expelled in 1933. His
sympathies never deviated from
[[Marxism]], however, and his
work continued to explore the
[[dialectic]]. He travelled
to Mexico in 1938, ostensibly for a conference on Surrealism at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico. There he got to meet the great
socialist artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo as well as the exiled
Leon Trotsky, with whom he wrote yet another manifesto, this time for
revolutionary art.
He returned to France at the outbreak of World War II and once more
volunteered his services in the medical corps. After France's surrender,
however, the Vichy government banned his writings and declared him an
enemy of the state. He escaped from France to Martinique, where he met
[[Césaire, Aimé]]. He returned
to France in 1946. He was an outspoken critic of France's involvement in
Algeria and was one of the signatories of the *Manifesto of the 121*
written to protest against the Algerian War. Surrealism continued after
the war, but its influence declined. It was succeeded by
[[Situationism]] in France
and [[Abstractionism]] in the
US.

[[bricolage]] The French word
for 'tinkering', 'making do', or even 'DIY'. Someone who engages in
*bricolage* is known as a *bricoleur*, which is the equivalent of
'handyman' or 'jack of all trades'. It has passed into the [[critical theory]] lexicon because of
French anthropologist [[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]]'s comparison
of western science and 'primitive' mythic thought in *La Pensée sauvage*
(1962), translated as *The Savage Mind* (1966), arguing that the latter
is a kind of *bricolage* because it is constrained to work with existing
material and is therefore only ever the contingent result of the
combination of things that were ready to hand. In contrast to an
engineer, the profession that personifies western science for
Lévi-Strauss, the *bricoleur* cannot plan or make projects since to do
so implies both that the necessary tools and materials can be obtained
as required and do not have to be ready to hand. [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Guattari, Félix]] describe
schizophrenic productions as *bricolage* in *L'Anti-Oedipe* (1972),
translated as *Anti-Oedipus* (1977).
