[[body]]

 Critical theory's
interest in the body (usually, though not exclusively, taken to mean the
human body) is quite diverse and dates back to French philosopher Ren√©
Descartes' s famous splitting of the mind from the body. With the
exception of Baruch de Spinoza, who vigorously decried philosophy's
ignorance of what the body can do, philosophy has tended to treat the
body with mistrust as the site of uncontrollable impulses and instincts.
This only began to change in the early twentieth century with the advent
of [[phenomenology]],
especially the work of [[Merleau-Ponty, Maurice]], who was
probably the first philosopher to attempt a genuine philosophy of the
body. In the latter half of the twentieth century, however, it is
[[feminism]] in all its forms
that has given the greatest attention to the body. On a philosophical
level, French feminist philosophers, starting with [[Beauvoir, Simone de]], have shown that
philosophy's neglect of the body is at one with its neglect of the issue
of sexual difference. The body, in this regard, is the site of an almost
essential form of sexual difference, which has in turn led to the
formation of a sex/gender binary. But as [[Butler, Judith]] has pointed out, it
is fallacious to think that there is a natural body that is distinct
from a cultural body, so to correlate sex with biology and gender with
culture is similarly mistaken. Along the same lines, [[Haraway, Donna]] has challenged the
formal boundaries of the body in two ways: on the one hand, she has
shown that the distinction between animal and human is difficult to
sustain in any absolute sense (not only are we genetically alike, we
also depend on animals in a range of different ways), while on the other
hand, she has argued that the human body itself has become a cyborg
because of its integration with machines. On a political level, using
the slogan 'body politics', feminism has confronted issues such as
prostitution, pornography, rape, contraception, abortion, and other
concerns which directly involve the body both physically and
symbolically such as anorexia, bulimia, and self-harm. As a lateral
extension of this kind of work [[Cultural Studies]] has examined the way
the body has become an object of cultural concern, even panic, by
exploring its representation in the media and the corresponding attempts
by people to imitate these images. Here the work of [[Foucault, Michel]], particularly his
concepts of [[biopower]] and
[[discipline]], has been
crucial.
