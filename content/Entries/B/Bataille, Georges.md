[[Bataille, Georges]]
(1897--1962) French religious historian, philosopher and novelist. For
most of his professional life he worked as a librarian, which not only
gave him access to vast collections of arcane texts and items but also
plenty of free time to trawl through them, as his various works amply
evidence. Contradicting the stereotypical image of the librarian as an
anti-social type who prefers books to people, Bataille was a great
organizer: he was one of the founding members of the Collège de
Sociologie (along with Roger Caillois and Michel Leiris) and its journal
*Documents*; he was co-founder of the journal *Acéphale* and its
associated secret society; and he was the founding editor of *Critique*.
He also was affiliated with the
[[Surrealism]] and helped
establish the off-shoot anti-fascist group Contre-Attaque.
Born in Billom in the Auvergne district of France, Bataille initially
wanted to be a priest, but abandoned these plans in his late teens and
instead studied medieval history, particularly religious history,
focusing on working with books and manuscripts. His first job was at the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, where he remained for over twenty
years. Then following a seven-month spell of medical leave, convalescing
with tuberculosis, he worked at libraries in Carpentras and Orleans.
Fittingly, it was to Bataille that the German Jewish writer and
philosopher [[Benjamin, Walter]] entrusted his
manuscripts when he fled Paris in 1940 after the German Army occupied
the city.
Bataille's name is inexorably tied to the concept of transgression. His
entire career can be seen as an investigation into both the actual
ontology of transgression and the anthropology of its apparent
necessity. For Bataille transgression is inherent in any and every
system, no matter how rigorously it seems to be excluded. His
exploration of transgression takes two main forms. First, and probably
best known, is his fiction---part essay, part treatise; his erotic
novels *Histoire de l'oeil* (1928), translated as *Story of the Eye*
(1967), and *Madame Edwarda* (1941) have been admired in print by Yukio
Mishima, [[Sontag, Susan]] and
[[Barthes, Roland]] and are a
staple part of any course on experimental fiction (that André Breton
attacked him for being an 'excremental' writer hasn't hurt his
reputation in this respect). Second is his philosophical and historical
accounts of the centrality of transgression to social life, the best
known work being *La Part maudite* (1949), translated as *The Accursed
Share* (1988).
Bataille's theory of transgression is this: every 'restricted economy',
his word for any putatively closed system or self-contained idea or
concept, always produces more than it can contain and is fractured by
this unacknowledged excess. Thus a notion like chastity only has meaning
insofar as it is acknowledged that it is the negative of carnality; the
fact that being chaste means choosing not to have sex means that the
idea of actually having sex is never far from the surface. By the same
token, the pleasure of transgression depends upon such restrictions
being imposed in the first place (this is what theorists like [[Foucault, Michel]] and [[Deleuze, Gilles]] mean when they say
power is productive).
Outside of philosophy, Bataille's most enduring influence has been in
the field of art history, particularly the group surrounding the journal
*October* which is interested primarily in modern and contemporary art.
