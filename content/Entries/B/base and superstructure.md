[[base and superstructure]]
Analogy proposed by [[Marx, Karl]] to characterize
modern society as a dual system consisting of two semi-autonomous (as
[[Althusser, Louis]] would
later characterize them) types of operations: the base is the economy,
the forces and relations of production, while the superstructure is the
non-economic support apparatus comprising the judiciary, government,
police, but also culture itself. Marx's most explicit articulation of
this concept is in his 1859 'Preface' to *A Contribution to the Critique
of the Political Economy*, but his meaning is much disputed. At issue is
whether or not the 'base' should be regarded as the cause of the
'superstructure' in some direct or indirect way. So-called 'vulgar'
Marxists generally take the view that the base is causal, whereas
'historical' or 'cultural' Marxists tend to take the view that the two
systems are mutually reinforcing.
