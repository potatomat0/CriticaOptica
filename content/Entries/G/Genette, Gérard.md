[[Genette, Gérard]]
(1930--2018) French
[[structuralism]] literary
theorist. Born in Paris, Genette studied at the École Normale
Supérieure, where his classmates included [[Derrida, Jacques]] and [[Bourdieu, Pierre]]. After an
obligatory period of teaching in lycées, Genette obtained a position at
the Sorbonne in 1963 and then a more permanent post at the École des
Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in 1967. Together with [[Todorov, Tzvetan]], and [[Cixous, Hélène]], he founded the
journal *Poétique* in 1970, which became a key organ of the
structuralist and
[[post-structuralism]]
movements in Paris and a significant rival to *Tel Quel*. Genette's work
focuses on the question of how literary writing works, that is, what
sets it apart from other forms of non-literary writing, but also how
does it achieve certain of its effects. His approach, consistent with
[[Lévi-Strauss, Claude]]'s original
geological inspiration for structuralism, tends to be stratified: he
investigates the ways different parts of the literary text interact and
devotes considerable attention to identifying and analysing these parts.
He enlarges the [[Russian Formalism]] binary of
[[animal studies]] to a
trinity by adding what he calls the narrative instance, namely the act
of telling the story itself, thus taking into account its
[[performative]] dimension.
Genette's star has waned in recent years with the movement away from
such purely formal questions towards more politically motivated problems
in literary theory. His key works are collected in a series of volumes
entitled *Figures I* (1966), *Figures II* (1969), and *Figures III*
(1972), a selection of which has been compiled and translated into
English as *Figures of Literary Discourse* (1984).
