[[Geneva School]]

 **1.** A
small group of linguists based in Geneva at the turn of the twentieth
century. The most prominent figure was [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]], whose work on
the linguistic [[sign]] was a
vital precursor to the founding of both
[[structuralism]] and
[[semiotics]]. Saussure's
contribution to scholarship might never have been known were it not for
the efforts of his former students, and fellow members of the Geneva
School, Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. It was they who transformed
incomplete lecture notes into the posthumously published *Cours de
linguistique générale* (1916), translated as *Course in General
Linguistics* (1959), upon which Saussure's lasting fame rests.
**2.** A small group of literary scholars using a combination of
[[phenomenology]] (inspired
by the work [[Husserl, Edmund]]) and [[Russian Formalism]] to analyse the
[[ontology]] of literature as
a specific art form and affective experience. The text was treated as
the realization of the author's consciousness and the critics sought its
deep structure by looking for and interpreting recurrent images and
symbolic patterns. All material facts, such as the biography of the
author, or the historical context, were set aside as extraneous. Its
core membership consisted of Georges Poulet, Jean-Pierre Richard, Marcel
Raymond, and Jean Starobinski. American literary critic [[Miller, J. Hillis]] was influenced by
their approach.
