[[gaze]] **(*le regard*)

** A
concept used by both [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]] and [[Lacan, Jacques]], though with
slightly different meanings, to formulate the
[[existentialism]] problem of
being looked at by another (for this reason, it is also sometimes
translated as 'the look'). Simply put, the problematic is this: If 'I'
as an observing subject have consciousness and the object 'I' gaze at
does not, then what does that mean to 'me' when another gazes upon me,
thus transforming 'me' into an object of their consciousness? The gaze
of the other inevitably degrades 'my' being-for-oneself and transforms
it into a being-for-others. In other words, it is the gaze that enables
the subject to recognize that the
[[Other]] is also a subject.
Commenting on Sartre's work, in a very early seminar, Lacan twists this
problem further and argues that in fact it is the object that gazes at
'us' and not the other way round. The gaze is not 'me' looking at the
other, but rather the other looking at me. Film theorists, particularly
[[Metz, Christian]] and Laura
Mulvey have used this concept to great effect in their analysis of the
function of cinema.
