[[Greimas, Algirdas Julien]]
(1917--92) [[structuralism]],
semiologist, whose work influenced figures as diverse as [[Barthes, Roland]] and [[Jameson, Fredric]] (an avid exponent
of Greimas's semiotic squares). He was part of a great generation of
(mainly) French scholars who, in the aftermath of World War II, thought
it both possible and desirable to take a more scientific approach to the
study of culture in all its forms.
Born in Lithuania, Greimas moved to France in 1936 to study law at the
University of Grenoble. He went back to Lithuania in 1940 and, after
enduring successive military occupations by the Germans then the
Soviets, returned to France in 1944 to complete a doctorate on the
vocabulary of clothing. In 1949 he took a job in Alexandria in Egypt,
where he met and became friends with Barthes, who had similarly been
posted there by the French Department of Cultural Affairs. Drawing on
three principal sources---namely, the Swiss linguist [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]], the Danish
linguist [[Hjelmslev, Louis]],
and Russian morphologist [[Propp, Vladimir]]---Greimas pioneered
a method of analysis he called structural semantics. This was the
subject of his magnum opus *Sémantique structurale* (1966), translated
as *Structural Semantics* (1983).
Greimas's aim was not to determine the meaning of specific words or
texts, but rather to understand how meaning is produced. Effectively a
generational model akin to [[Chomsky, Noam]]'s model of
generational grammar, structural semantics is an extreme form of
formalism. Also known as semiotic reduction, structural semantics treats
the content of the text as a superficial expression (or
enunciation-spectacle) of a deeper drama played out between two
interrelated structures he called
[[actant]] and functions. In
this way, virtually all forms of textual production from the writing of
scientific treatises through to folktales and cookbooks (to list only
some of the types of text Greimas analysed) can be treated as
narratives. Moreover, it holds that the content is independent of the
narrative, or what amounts to the same thing it shows that a particular
narrative function or actant can be fulfilled by a near infinite variety
of content.
