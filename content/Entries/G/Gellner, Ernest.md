[[Gellner, Ernest]] 
(1925--95)


Czech historian and social anthropologist. Born in Paris to a family of
Bohemian Jews, Gellner grew up in Prague. In 1939 his family moved to
Britain to escape persecution by the Nazis. Gellner won a scholarship to
Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics, and
economics. But after only a year of study, he left university to join
the Czech army. He returned to Prague after the war, but disgusted by
the communist takeover he left after only a few months and resumed study
at Balliol. His first job in 1947 was at the University of Edinburgh in
the Department of Moral Philosophy. Two years later he took a position
in the Sociology Department at the London School of Economics, where he
was to remain for two decades. In 1974, he moved to Cambridge as the
head of the Department of Anthropology, remaining there for nearly 20
years before fulfilling a lifelong dream of returning to Prague as the
head of a George Soros funded institute to study the rise of nationalism
in Eastern Europe. Gellner shot to prominence in 1959 with the
publication of *Words and Things*, which attacked the so-called ordinary
language philosophers, particularly [[Wittgenstein, Ludwig]], for the way
they privilege convention and community‐established norms of meaning.
Probably his most-read work, though, is *Nations and Nationalism*
(1983), which, alongside the work of [[Anderson, Benedict]], continues to set
the agenda for debate about the subject of what constitutes nationalism.
