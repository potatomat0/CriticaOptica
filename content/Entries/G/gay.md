[[gay]]

 Originally an adjective
to describe a light-hearted, frivolous, or joyful attitude, it was used
in the early part of the twentieth century to refer to someone with an
open-minded or unconventional approach to sexual propriety. Until the
1950s this was its most widely recognized meaning, but in the middle
part of the century it also began to be used as a synonym for
homosexuality in general. This latter meaning emerged as the dominant
meaning of the word in the 1970s. The annual Gay Pride parades held
around the world in memory of the 1969 Stonewall riots have helped
transform the word 'gay' into a generally positive and affirmative term.
In the early part of the twenty-first century, 'gay' has acquired a new
meaning, apparently unrelated to its other meanings, as a pejorative
with the approximate meaning of 'uncool, outdated, pathetic, and
generally undesirable'.
