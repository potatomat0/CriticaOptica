[[Glissant, Édouard]]
(1928--2011) Caribbean writer and critical theorist. He is best known as
one of the principal architects behind
[[Creoleness]], the movement
to celebrate the cultural, ethnic, and political heterogeneity of the
Caribbean. This heterogeneity is born of a fusion of the cultures
African slaves brought with them to the so-called 'New World' and the
culture and languages of their masters (predominantly, English, French,
Spanish, and Portuguese). Neither the culture of the master nor the
culture of the slave survived this interaction intact; both were
transformed. In his theoretical writings he acknowledges the influence
of [[Deleuze, Gilles]] and
[[Guattari, Félix]],
especially their concept of the
[[rhizome]]. Interestingly,
as [[Gilroy, Paul]] notes in
his book *The Black Atlantic* (1993), this connection to Deleuze and
Guattari has been erased from some of the English translations of his
work. Gilroy speculates this may be in an effort to preserve a certain
kind of nativism.
For Glissant, the rhizome is a powerful and apt image for Caribbean
culture---it may appear unified and coherent on the surface, but beneath
the surface there is an incredible tangle of roots and origins that give
it its rich character. Creole culture, the product of this rhizomatic
root structure, is therefore inherently plural, according to Glissant, a
fact that needs to be remembered in the face of certain nationalist and
racist movements that extol the virtues of a singular cultural origin
(whether it be that of the colonial master or that of some putative
African past). For this reason, Glissant was opposed to the concept of
[[négritude]] extolled by
[[Senghor, Léopold]] and [[Césaire, Aimé]], but he did not
reject it outright. Rather he saw the concept of creole as completing it
by enabling the celebration of black identity as it actually is today,
as opposed to a kind of melancholic longing for a past and inevitably
fantasized identity. The interweaving of dreams and reality is a
powerful theme in Glissant's work.
Glissant is the author of several novels as well as collections of
poetry and essays. He was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for literature
in 1992, the year in which fellow Caribbean poet Derek Walcott won it,
but unfortunately did not live long enough to win it himself.
