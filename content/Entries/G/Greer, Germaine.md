[[Greer, Germaine]]
 (1939--)


Australian [[feminism]]
scholar, political activist, and journalist. She became a household name
with the international bestseller *The Female Eunuch* (1970), a vanguard
text in [[Second Wave feminism]]. Greer argued that
culture has separated women from their
[[libido]], their
[[desire]], and their
sexuality, thus rendering them virtual eunuchs. Her larger quarrel is
that this separation of women from their libido is in effect a
separation of them from their capacity to act, and as such it is
politically stifling. If
[[feminism]] is to achieve
its goals, she argues, and actually liberate women from the confining
strictures of [[patriarchy]]
then it needs to put women back in touch with their sexuality. To do
this, Greer argued, women should give up celibacy, monogamy, even the
nuclear family. Not surprisingly, Greer's theses were regarded as
provocative and her work drew considerable criticism as well as lavish
praise. Following the success of this book, Greer has maintained a
high-profile existence championing the cause of feminism, not always in
a way that is greeted with widespread agreement, but rarely if ever in a
way that doesn't provoke thought and comment. She has published several
books since, but none as successful as her first.
