[[Gilroy, Paul]]
 (1956--)

 Black
British [[Cultural Studies]]
scholar renowned for his work on the politics of
[[race]] in Britain and
America. He completed his PhD at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural
Studies working under the direction of [[Hall, Stuart]], and has held jobs in
both the UK and the US. His first major book, *'There Ain't No Black in
the Union Jack': The Cultural Politics of Race and Nation* (1987) grew
out of his PhD. He argued that black people growing up in Britain, as he
did, are British and in being so have redefined the meaning of that
word. Putting it simply and bluntly, British culture would not be what
it is in the absence of black immigrants and imported black culture,
e.g. black musical forms such as jazz, ska, and rock. Thus one has to
look at the various forms of nationalism that exist (as exemplified,
say, in the different political party platforms operative at a
particular moment in history) rather than the idea of the nation itself
in order to understand racism. In effect, he argued it is more useful to
think about the complexities of being both black and British than it is
to try to delineate the ways by which one can only be either black or
British. In doing so he rejects the absolutist position that correlates
race and racism to skin colour alone. He prefers to see the connection
in more dynamic and dialectical terms, as arising from the intersection
of multiple historical and political currents.
Gilroy's interest in the 'doubleness' of being both black and British
(or black and American) is explored in more detail and given a more
rigorous conceptual form in his subsequent and undoubtedly most
important book, *The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness*
(1993). Organized around the image of ships sailing across the Atlantic
(it is in this regard an early contribution to what would become known
as [[mobility studies]]),
*The Black Atlantic* is an exercise in counter-history, excavating the
obscured or occluded contributions of black people to
[[modernity]]. Following the
work of [[James, C. L. R.]]
(among others), Gilroy emphasizes that European modernity could not have
existed without the labour of black slaves---it was their sweat in the
cane fields and cotton fields of America that created the wealth that
underpinned Europe's rise as a power. Drawing on [[Du Bois, W. E. B.]]'s concept of [[double-consciousness]]---the
difficulty of being simultaneously inside a culture and excluded from
it---Gilroy asks whether or not the mobility of black people across the
Atlantic affects how one should understand this concept and wonders
whether it is ever going to be possible to reconcile the two disjoined
consciousnesses. Gilroy also argues against the idea that cultural
formations can be understood as being congruent with national
borders---cultures of domination and liberation are both, he argues,
transnational, particularly so in the case of black people, forced to
move from one continent to another.
Gilroy's subsequent books have extended this analysis by delving deeper
into the affective and political economies of this structural
in-betweenness, focusing particularly on what Gilroy diagnoses as
[[melancholia]] in *After Empire: Melancholia or Convivial Culture?* (2004) and *Postcolonial Melancholia* (2005). He argues that Britain has never been able to come
to terms with the loss of its empire following World War II, nor can it
reconcile its ambivalence towards the violence that underpinned the
acquisition and maintenance of its empire. On the one hand, as a nation
it is obviously deeply embarrassed (if not ashamed) of the amply
documented massacres and cruelties committed in the name of
empire---Mike Davis provides a particularly horrifying picture of
British callousness in his account of the Bengal famines in his *Late Victorian Holocausts* (2002)---but it is also unashamedly proud of it
too. As such, it is impossible, Gilroy argues, for Britain to give up
its false image of itself as a great power and confront the truth of its
decline. He was awarded the 2019 Holberg Prize.
