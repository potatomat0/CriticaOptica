[[German Expressionism]]

 A
[[modernism]] film movement
that developed in Germany in the first part of the twentieth century,
lasting roughly from 1919 until 1924. The best-known examples of German
Expressionist film are: *The Cabinet of Dr Caligari* (director Wiene,
1919), *Metropolis* (director Lang, 1926), and *Nosferatu* (director
Murnau, 1921). Contemporaneous with the tumultuous Weimar period and the
rise of German fascism, its dark, anti-realist aesthetic was inspired by
the pan-European movement of
[[Expressionism]] in the
arts, typified by such diverse figures as Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch,
and Vincent Van Gogh; more locally, it took inspiration from the
Munich-based *der Blaue Reiter* (the blue rider) group of artists and
the Dresden-based *die Br√ºcke* (the bridge) group, whose members
included Franz Marc, Wassily Kandinsky, Ernst Kirchner, and Fritz Beyl.
Like Expressionist art, which was similarly influenced by
[[psychoanalysis]], its
subject matter tends to be focused on ambivalent questions to do with
sexuality and emotion, which it explores via supernatural and science
fictional tales. German Expressionism was very influential on Hollywood,
particularly [[film noir]]
(many of the directors, including Lang, Lubitsch, and Murnau, migrated
to the US when the Nazis came to power in 1933).
