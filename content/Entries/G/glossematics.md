[[glossematics]]
**(Glossematik)** [[Hjelmslev, Louis]]'s name for his
theory of language. Like [[Saussure, Ferdinand de]], one of his key
inspirations, Hjelmslev took the position that language is arbitrary in
relation to the real world, which is to say there is nothing about a
tree, for example, that necessitates it being called a tree, a fact that
is amply proven by the great variety of different words different
languages use for ostensibly the same object. By the same token, not all
languages name things in the same way---his two demonstrations of this
have become quite famous: the first compares Welsh and English words for
colours, showing that the Welsh word 'glas' covers a spectrum of colours
that in English would be shared between green, blue, and gray; the
second compares Danish, German, and French words for trees individually
and collectively and again shows that there is a disparity in the way
they name the world. His conclusion, which has much in common with
Saussure, was that words are
[[sign]] and as such do not
refer to the real world, but rather express our sense of it.
His comparison between languages served another, deeper purpose.
Hjelmslev's ultimate goal with glossematics was to abstract what is
common to all languages. Thus he compares the phrases 'jeg v√©d det
ikke', 'je ne sais pas', and 'I don't know' in Danish, French, and
English respectively and suggests that although constructed differently
they can all be said to share a single thought or 'purport'. The rather
odd word 'purport' translates the Danish word 'mening', which might also
have been rendered as meaning, although this too would have been
problematic because it would have obscured the originality of
Hjelmslev's theory. The French translation (the one Barthes, Deleuze,
Greimas, and others relied on), which renders purport as 'sens', is
perhaps a better choice, inasmuch that in English it implies both the
words 'meaning' and 'direction' without implying direct intent as
purport does. [[Kristeva, Julia]], among others,
has criticized the notion of purport for preserving a transcendental
element in what is otherwise meant to be an immanent theory of language.
For Hjelmslev, as a process purport is equivalent to substance, as
though the intent of a particular statement is like clay that can be
moulded into a variety of different forms. But, having said that, looked
at from a system point of view, it does not have an independent
existence---it can only be a substance insofar as it has form. Thus, in
addition to content as substance, there is always a content-form as well
that is independent of the content and forms it into a content
substance. The shape of a building is, for all intents and purposes
independent of the materials used to build it; but it is also
constrained by those materials, in that there are only certain things
concrete and steel can be made to do. Hjelmslev recognizes this and
accounts for it in his system by adding a dimension of expression to his
grid, again distinguishing system and process within it. As process,
expression refers to the acquired limits in the range of references of
particular words (as he points out, the Welsh 'glas' has a greater range
of reference than its putative cognate in English 'blue'); as system, he
notes that the same sound can have different meanings in different
languages ('got' in English sounds the same as 'Gott' (god) in German,
but doesn't mean the same thing). Thus expression-purport and
content-purport must be seen as independent of each other.
Not unjustifiably, the Italian linguist and bestselling novelist
[[Eco, Umberto]] describes
Hjelmslev's theory as having 'Byzantine complexity'. This becomes
apparent as soon as one tries to unravel the way Hjelmslev weaves
together four new terms to explain purport and its relation to language:
form of content, form of expression, content of form, and content of
expression. These may be considered rewrites of Saussure's basic binary
pair, [[feminism]] and
signified, although the truth is they go way beyond Saussure's thinking.
