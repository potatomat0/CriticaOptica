[[Goffman, Erving]] 
(1922--82)


Canadian sociologist. His work is renowned for demonstrating that
apparently instinctual behaviour, such as winking, glancing, gesturing,
is more socially organized than previously thought. His work uncovered
and classified the rules and presuppositions of these types of
unconscious or unthought social conduct. He created a range of new
concepts to describe this behaviour that have become part of common
parlance both within academic sociology and in more everyday situations.
Goffman came to sociology almost by accident. He originally enrolled to
study natural sciences at university, but did not complete his degree.
After a spell working for the National Film Board he became interested
in sociology and resumed his studies. For his PhD at the University of
Chicago, he conducted an ethnographic study of rural life in the
Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland. Graduating in 1953, Goffman
immediately began working on the book that would propel him into
international fame, namely *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*
(1956). Although it is not strictly speaking a book of the dissertation,
it nonetheless draws on the ideas about social interaction Goffman
pioneered in his thesis. In particular, it developed the idea that all
social interaction is a variety of performance that stage-manages how
'we' wish to be seen and perceived by others. He thus described facial
expressions, which are one means by which we manage others' impressions
of us, as 'face-work'.
From 1955 to 1958 Goffman worked on a National Institute of Mental
Health‚Äêfunded ethnographic project at St Elizabeth's Hospital in
Washington DC. He used this as an opportunity to gather material for his
book *Asylums* (1961), one of the most influential pieces of sociology
in the twentieth century, as well as a moving and affecting account of
the dehumanizing processes mental patients are subjected to. Goffman was
particularly interested in the social and political mechanisms whereby
certain behaviours come to be coded as clinically insane and not merely
eccentric. Goffman described the asylum as a 'total institution', whose
function is to change people---they are, he said, experiments in what
can be done to alter the self. He catalogued the way rituals of
humiliation, debasement, and profanations of the self were deployed by
the institution to break subjects down and make them amenable to
self-transformation. Goffman also documented the ways patients built a
life for themselves despite the institution's control over their daily
activities---[[Certeau, Michel de]]'s concept of
making-do can be traced to this source.
He attempted to synthesize his observations on everyday interactions in
*Frame Analysis* (1974), which was written as an alternative to [[Garfinkel, Harold]]'s concept of
[[ethnomethodology]]. [[Butler, Judith]] utilizes this work
in her essays on war. Although Goffman continues to be read today, his
work has been criticized, somewhat paradoxically, for being on the one
hand overly impressionistic and on the other hand overly systemic.
