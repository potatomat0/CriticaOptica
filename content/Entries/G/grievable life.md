[[grievable life]] 

In *Frames of War* (2009) [[Butler, Judith]]  argues that
grievability is the presupposition of a life that matters. Indeed, she
will go so far as to say a life that is not grievable is something
living that is other than life. In wartime, for example, the enemy dead
are often depicted as ungrievable---their lives only matter insofar as
they are dead. Butler argues that the apprehension of grievability is a
precondition of the perception of
[[precarity]] (in war, the
enemy, no matter how vulnerable to attack they may be, are never
portrayed as existing precariously). Her aim is to provide a way of
rethinking some of the key moral and ethical pillars in the debates that
have emerged over the past couple of decades relating to the 'right to
life'---not just with regards abortion, but also voluntary euthanasia.
Specifically she wants to reverse the usual line of argument that holds
that all life is worth living, i.e., worth saving because it is 'life',
and instead argue that it is only because we would grieve the absence of
that life that it is worth saving. Therefore, grief is the precondition
of the life worth saving and not life itself (or what
[[agency]] calls [[bare life]]). Our ethical
obligations are, she says, to the conditions that make life grievable,
not to life itself. This is because without that grievability we would
not be moved to want to sustain life in the first place.
[Groupe d'Information sur les
Prisons](#Xcf01e4ff5b3e66b26bcb76ae7c250300d7721e0)
([[GIP]],
Group for
Information on Prisons) Established in 1970 by [[Foucault, Michel]] in collaboration
with Jean-Marie Domenach and Pierre Vidal-Naquet for the purpose of
distributing information about conditions in French prisons. It was not
primarily a prison-reform advocacy group, though of course its purpose
in making known the terrible conditions in which prisoners were forced
to live was to foster the call for change. Operating in the age before
email and the Internet, the various members of the group gathered
information by interviewing prisoners, their wives, and guards, and
distributing the results of their research via samizdat pamphlets. The
group attracted as members such luminaries as [[Deleuze, Gilles]], Jean Genet, and
[[Sartre, Jean-Paul]].
