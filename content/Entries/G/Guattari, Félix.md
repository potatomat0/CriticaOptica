[[Guattari, Félix]] 
(1930--92)


French psychoanalyst, political activist, and philosopher. The author of
several important works, *Psychanalyse et transversalité* (1972)
translated as *Psychoanalysis and Transversality* (2015); *La Révolution
moléculaire* (1980), translated as *Molecular Revolution* (1984); and
*Cartographies schizoanalytiques* (1989), translated as *Schizoanalytic Cartographies* (2013), Guattari is ultimately best known for the books
he co-wrote with French philosopher [[Deleuze, Gilles]]: *L'Anti-Œdipe:
Capitalisme et Schizophrénie* (1972), translated as *Anti-Oedipus*
(1977); *Kafka: Pour une Littérature Mineure* (1975), translated as
*Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature* (1986); *Mille Plateaux: Capitalisme
et Schizophrénie 2* (1980), translated as *A Thousand Plateaus:
Capitalism and Schizophrenia* (1987); and *Qu'est-ce que la
Philosophie?* (1991), translated as *What is Philosophy?* (1994).
Guattari's contribution to these collaborative works tends to be
overlooked, sometimes deliberately so (as is the case with authors like
[[Badiou, Alain]] and [[Žižek, Slavoj]], who take the view
that Guattari was a detrimental influence on Deleuze, distorting his
'pure' philosophy in favour of a corrupted politics), but more often out
ignorance. This is changing as more and more of Guattari's works are
translated into English. All his major works are now available in
English, as are the more esoteric pieces such as his screenplay for a
never-made science fiction film *A Love of Uiq* (2016) and his travel
musings on Japan, a country he visited several times, *Machinic Eros:
Writings on Japan* (2015). If the Anglophone world has been slow in
recognizing Guattari's singular contributions, there has been no such
tardiness in Hispanophone and Lusaphone realms of Latin America. Brazil,
Argentina, and Uruguay all have Guattari-focused research centres.
It is difficult to summarize a career as rich and as varied as
Guattari's, but it can be said that his main intellectual goal was to
overcome the limitations of
[[psychoanalysis]]---as he
saw them---by creating a re-engineered version of it. It is often said
Guattari rejected psychoanalysis out of hand, but this is incorrect. As
he makes clear in several of his works, psychoanalysis remained an
essential starting point for him, particularly
[[Freud, Anna]]'s conception of the
[[unconscious]], which he
always said was a brilliant invention. However, he also thought
psychoanalysis was flawed in two main ways emblematized by Freud's
emphasis on the [[Oedipus complex]]: (i) it can only
grasp the productions of the unconscious by way of analogy (as symbols
of something other than themselves); and (ii) it assumes that the
unconscious is concerned only with the psychosexual drama of family
relations and not the broader concerns of what he called micropolitical
life. Guattari's work seeks to overturn these two limitations by
inventing a mode of analysis he called
[[schizoanalysis]], and with
that a host of new concepts.
His most influential invention was undoubtedly the concept of the *desiring-machine, which underwent a number of different iterations and
eventually evolved into the more well-known concept of the
[[assemblage]]. Gary Genosko,
in his illuminating account of Guattari's work *Félix Guattari: A
Critical Introduction* (2009), traces the lineage of the concept of the
desiring-machine back to Lacan's concept of the [**objet (petit)
a*](#Xab1e3b1ebad0e9a2e7bd309b42992175f19466c)---it is both a cause of
desire and an alienation of the subject's desire. Insofar as the
subject's desire is motivated by something they lack, their desire does
not come from within; therefore, it is said to be alienated. But
Guattari did not agree with Lacan that the *objet (petit) a* causes
desire; rather, he saw it as a representation of desire, a means by
which desire becomes visible and tangible to the subject. Thus, in daily
life subjects constantly interact with, create, and destroy
desiring-machines. The analytic task is to ask how these machines
function.
Before he met Deleuze, Guattari had already gained notoriety in France
as a political activist. He was known in the French press as 'Mr Anti-'
for his public campaigning for a range of causes from the decolonization
of Algeria, the improved treatment of prisoners in French prisons (he
was a member of [[Foucault, Michel]]'s [[Groupe d’Information sur les Prisons]]), the improved
treatment of the mentally ill in French psychiatric hospitals, and the
establishment of free radio, to gay rights and green politics. In 1973
he outraged national sensibilities by publishing a special issue of the
journal *Recherches* edited by Guy Hocquenghem and René Scherer
provocatively entitled 'Trois milliards de pervers: Grande Encyclopédie
des Homosexualités' (Three Billion Perverts: An Encyclopedia of
Homosexualities). French courts banned it and ordered all copies
destroyed. Guattari was also fined 600 francs, but he proudly never
paid. More controversially, he collaborated with the Italian Marxist
theorist, [[Negri, Antonio]],
who was arrested in 1977 on charges of terrorism for his association
with the Red Brigades. Guattari also spoke against the extradition from
Germany to France of Klaus Croissant, a German lawyer sympathetic to the
Baader-Meinhof Group; and in the late 1950s and early 1960s he carried
cash for the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front),
the guerrilla army fighting for independence from French rule in
Algeria.
As important as Guattari's meeting with Deleuze was to his intellectual
formation and his career, it is arguable that his meeting with Jean Oury
(1924--2014) at the tender age of 15 was far more consequential. Oury
recruited Guattari to work at the private psychiatric clinic La Borde
which he founded in 1953 with the aim of providing a radically new form
of care inspired by the work of the radical Spanish psychiatrist
François Tosquelles, whose rallying cry was 'de-institutionalize the
institution'. Guattari provides a brief account of his time at La Borde
in *De Leros a La Borde* (2012). The importance of the La Borde
experiment has been widely recognized. There is a French documentary,
*La Moindre des choses* (Every Little Thing) directed by Nicolas
Philibert, which provides an illuminating glimpse of life there.
Guattari's daughter Emmanuelle Guattari, who spent a large part of her
childhood there, wrote a delightful memoir about La Borde too, *La Petite Borde* (2012), translated as *I, Little Asylum* (2014).
Guattari received formal training in psychoanalysis from France's most
important interpreter of Freud, [[Lacan, Jacques]], achieving the
status of 'analyste membre' (member analyst) in 1969. This entitled him
to practice as a psychoanalyst, something he did for his entire
professional career. Although he remained a member of Lacan's school,
the [[École Freudienne de Paris]], until its dissolution
in 1980 shortly before the master's death, Guattari's relationship to
Lacan and Lacanian psychoanalysis was at best ambivalent. The
publication of Guattari's notebooks, *The Anti-Oedipus Papers* (2006),
has made it clear just how strained relations were between them,
especially after the publication of *Anti-Oedipus* (even though that
work was, in the words of its authors, designed to give Lacan a bit of
assistance).
Guattari is often linked to the anti-psychiatrists [[Laing, Ronald David]] and [[Cooper, David]], but, despite
expressing a certain sympathy for their position, he did not agree with
their strategies. He shared their view that medical psychiatry is too
normative because its basic therapeutic move is to try to restore the
patient to something it supposes is a prior state of psychological
wellness or normalcy. However, he disagreed with their view that madness
is nothing more than a prejudiced social construction of a particular
set of behaviours. He argued that this both ignored the actual state of
affairs and in doing so put lives at risk because people with severe
forms of schizophrenia cannot always cope with the demands of so-called
normal life. The aim of psychiatric care, for Guattari, should be to
create conditions that enable schizophrenic patients to have a life, but
not to determine or decide what kind of life they should have. The
concept of the assemblage as a way of thinking about the specificities
of living arrangements grew out of this concern.
Towards the end of his life, Guattari developed a theory of World
Integrated Capitalism, a forerunner to theories of globalization, and a
major influence on [[Hardt, Michael]] and Antonio Negri's
concept of [[Empire]]. He
also wrote influentially about the need to integrate the environment
into political thinking in *Les Trois écologies* (1989), translated as
*The Three Ecologies* (2000), and *Chaosmose* (1992), translated as
*Chaosmosis* (1995). *See also*
