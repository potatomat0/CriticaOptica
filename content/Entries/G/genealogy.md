[[genealogy]]

 French historian
[[Foucault, Michel]]'s term,
borrowed in this sense from [[Nietzsche, Friedrich]], for his
research methodology, which was in turn superseded by the notion of
[[archaeology]]. First
outlined in a 1971 essay entitled, 'Nietzsche, Genealogy, History'
(reprinted in the collection, *Language, Counter-Memory, Practice*,
edited by Donald Bouchard), genealogy aims to uncover the implicit
systems or unwritten rules (what Foucault himself later referred to as
[[discursive practice]])
which taken together comprise lived society. As is true of so many of
Foucault's concepts, genealogy was intended to break with the
conventions of the history of ideas. In particular, Foucault wanted to
challenge three postulates he saw as fallacious, namely the assumptions
that history is an attempt to uncover the essence of things, or some
primordial truth; that the most important moment is the moment of birth;
and that the origin of a thing is also its truth. Instead he proposed
that history should concern itself with descent and emergence. History,
Foucault argues, is not the result of the deliberate acts of
individuals; it is rather the product of the unintended and unexpected
coalescence of millions of individual acts. So the only way to chart it
is to try to see how certain accidents and departures give rise to new
solidities over time. Foucault's career was devoted to devising the
conceptual means of articulating such silent events.
