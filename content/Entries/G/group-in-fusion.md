[[group-in-fusion]]

 (*groupe en
fusion*) French philosopher [[Sartre, Jean-Paul]]'s term for a group
of people united by a common purpose. A crucial component of *Critique de la Raison Dialectique* (1960), translated as *Critique of Dialectical
Reason* (1976), Sartre's theory is that the majority of people are
[[displacement]] from one
another for the majority of time, a state he refers to as
[[seriality]]. What they
lack, he argues, is
[[praxis]], namely the will
to get involved in the political process. The group-in-fusion is not an
'innocent' or 'ideal' form in that it can refer to both progressive and
fascistic types of [[social movement]].
