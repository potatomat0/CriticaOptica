[[Garfinkel, Harold]]
(1917--2011) American sociologist. His work is interested in the problem
of how 'we' accomplish mutual intelligibility through cooperative
processes in our day-to-day social interactions. Garfinkel's thesis was
that the capacity to speak does not by itself explain how communication
takes place. One can see what he means by this by travelling in a
country where one does not speak the local language---what is striking
is the degree to which one can still communicate by means of cooperative
processes, whereby people teach each other how to understand what they
are saying, often by resorting to hand gestures and pictures. Garfinkel
called his approach to the study of human interaction
[[ethnomethodology]]. It is a
somewhat confusing term because it does not name a specific method that
analysts should use, but rather refers to the fact that Garfinkel's
analytic interest is in the methods people use in particular situations
to communicate, and more importantly to 'fit in' with society. Garfinkel
famously conducted what he called 'breach experiments' as a means of
better understanding what it is people do---the aim of these experiments
is to do something socially unexpected in a given setting and see if
that can reveal the usually unspoken rules about what one ought to do.
For example, he asked his students to take a watermelon to the
dry-cleaner's and see what happened when they tried to arrange for it to
be dry-cleaned. His most well-known work, and for a long time his only
book, is *Studies in Ethnomethodology* (1967). It contains several
groundbreaking essays, of which two have become particularly important.
The first deals with the way juries decide verdicts; the second has to
do with the processes
[[transgender]] people go
through in order to become a different gender.
