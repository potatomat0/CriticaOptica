[[Goldmann, Lucien]] 
(1913--70)


Romanian-born, Paris-based
[[Marxism]] sociologist of
literature whose theory of structural parallels or homologies was very
influential in the 1950s and 1960s. Born in Bucharest, he began his
studies there, but soon moved to Vienna to study German philology. It
was there that he first came into contact with the work of [[Lukács, György]], which proved to be
a lifelong interest. During World War II he was initially incarcerated
in Paris, where he was studying at the time, but he was able to get away
to Switzerland where he got a job as an assistant to the great child
psychologist Jean Piaget. He completed a doctorate there on Kant. After
the war he returned to Paris. He held positions at the Centre Nationale
de Recherche Scientifique and the École Pratique des Hautes Études. His
work foregrounded the problems of [[class consciousness]] and
[[reification]]. In *Le Dieu
caché: étude sur la vision tragique dans les Pensées de Pascal et le
théâtre de Racine* (1955), translated as *The Hidden God: A Study of
Tragic Vision in the Pensées of Pascal and the Tragedies of Racine*
(1964), Goldmann posited a homology between class situation, world view,
and artistic form, the implication being that each of these three things
can be treated as synonymous with the other two, so that a study of an
artistic object can yield knowledge of both class and world view.
Because of this facility, enabling the study of one thing to function as
the study of another thing, the theory of homology was initially quite
attractive, but would subsequently come under fire for oversimplifying
things. Goldmann enlarged upon the idea in his posthumously published
*Pour une sociologie du roman* (1973), translated as *Towards a
Sociology of the Novel* (1974), making what he called a 'rigorous
homology' between the novel form and [[everyday life]] in capitalist society.
