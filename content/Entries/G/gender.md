[[gender]]

 The set of
behavioural, cultural, psychological, and social characteristics and
practices associated with
[[masculinity]] and
[[femininity]]. The notion of
gender was used in [[Second Wave feminism]] to separate
individual attitudes and actions from physiology in order to undermine
the [[biological determinism]] thesis which
holds that cultural attitudes are simply a reflection of the specific
nature of the [[body]]. By
contrast, feminism claimed that attitudes are fluid with respect to
biological sex and that it is
[[culture]] rather than
nature which shapes these. As [[Beauvoir, Simone de]] famously put it,
one is not born a woman. Gender is rather an
[[identity]] one adopts or
creates. American
[[ethnomethodology]] Harold
Garfinkel and American sociologist [[Goffman, Erving]] argue that gender
identity is something that has to be learned and constantly managed.
Their work chimed well with American psychologist Robert Stoller who
showed that in the case of sex reassignment surgery it was a relatively
simple procedure to correct the body, but much more problematic to undo
the learned social behaviour. It was further argued by feminism that the
very notion of gender is itself influenced and shaped by other equally
powerful cultural forces such as
[[race]] and
[[class]], there being a
significant difference in terms of relative opportunities between being
a white middle-class woman living in a western city and a poor non-white
woman. In recent times, work on gender has been dominated by [[Butler, Judith]], who argues that
the sex/gender distinction should be regarded as regulatory apparatus
that positions sex as 'natural' so as to make gender roles appear
'normal'. Society, she argues, calls upon us to perform masculinity and
femininity and though it appears that we may choose between the two, the
crucial point is that we cannot choose not to have any gender at all.
Thus gender is a highly
[[ambivalence]] category in
Butler's view. As [[Haraway, Donna]] points out in an
extended essay on the question of gender in *Simians, Cyborgs and Women*
(1991), the sex/gender distinction is also an artefact of the English
language---German, for instance, uses only one word, *Geschlecht*, to
encompass both meanings, while not coinciding exactly with either---and
other cultures confront this issue in different ways, according to
different social and cultural pressures.
