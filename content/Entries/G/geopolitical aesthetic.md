[[geopolitical aesthetic]]

 A
type of narrative whose essential subject is the inter-relations between
nation states. [[Jameson, Fredric]] coined the concept
for a series of lectures he gave at the British Film Institute in London
in 1990 dealing with the differences between First World, Second World,
and [[Third World]] cinemas.
Subsequently published as a book entitled *The Geopolitical Aesthetic*
(1992), these lectures highlight the difficulty film-makers face in
representing the relationship between nations. In later work Jameson has
suggested that films like *Dirty Pretty Things* (director Frears, 2001),
*In This World* (director Winterbottom, 2003), and the British TV
miniseries *Traffik* (director Reid, 1989), which revolve around
international criminal conspiracies---illegal human organ trading,
people smuggling, and drug smuggling respectively---call to attention
the way the lives of people in different parts of the world are
inextricably linked. *See also* [cognitive
