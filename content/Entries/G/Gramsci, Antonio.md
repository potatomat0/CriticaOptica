[[Gramsci, Antonio]]
(1891--1937) Italian
[[Marxism]] philosopher and
political theorist. His influence on twentieth-century [[Western Marxism]], particularly in
[[Cultural Studies]], is
incalculable. [[Anderson, Perry]], [[Hall, Stuart]], Ranajit Guha,
[[Laclau, Ernesto]], Tom Nairn,
and [[Williams, Raymond]] were
all influenced by his thought. In large part this is because of the way
Gramsci wove culture into his theory of the political economy. For
Gramsci, politics cannot be understood if it is thought of solely in
terms of economic and political domination: one must also reckon with
the processes and practices of
[[culture]] that give a
particular regime its character. In *How to Change the World* (2011),
[[Hobsbawm, Eric]] argued that
Gramsci's originality, and hence his importance to [[critical theory]], lay in the way he
combined the problem of overthrowing capitalism and replacing it with
socialism into a single continuum. Thus, the essential revolutionary
problem in Gramsci's work is not how to take power, but how to ensure
one's power is accepted as legitimate.
Hobsbawm contextualized Gramsci's thinking by noting that he wrote in a
time of bitter defeats for the working-class people of Europe, but in
contrast to many other thinkers of this period he did not hold that this
defeat left the winners and losers unchanged. He worried that the defeat
would give rise to a longer-term weakening of revolutionary ardour by
means of a process he called 'passive revolution'. His concern was that
the ruling class would grant minor concessions to the working
class---e.g. the eight-hour day and the forty-hour week---that would
contain their passion for change and, even more damagingly, that the
working class would begin to accept defeat as a sign of their impotence.
In order to theorize this problematic Gramsci adopted the concept of
[[hegemony]] from the
writings of Lenin and re-engineered it as a supple tool for rethinking
the complexities of bourgeois power in the West.
According to Perry Anderson in *The Antinomies of Antonio Gramsci*
(2017), Gramsci's emphasis on hegemony and the problem of the acceptance
of power reflected his direct experience with organizing and leading
labour organizations, something his predecessors Marx and Lenin lacked.
Gramsci's political and literary apprenticeship was served writing for
socialist newspapers from his mid-teens until his early twenties. Fiat
and Lancia were then setting up factories in Turin, moving it towards
the giant industrial city it would become, and Gramsci helped the new
factory workers to organize trade unions. He joined the *Partito Socialista Italiano* ([[GIP]],
Italian Socialist
Party) in 1913. In 1919 he helped found the weekly newspaper *L'Ordine
Nuovo* (The New Order), which was recognized by Lenin as ideologically
closest to his own Bolshevik programme. The editors of this periodical
formed the core of the splinter group Partito Communista d'Italia
([[GIP]],
Italian Communist
Party) which Gramsci helped form in 1921. Gramsci became leader of the
PCI in 1924.
In 1924 Gramsci was elected to the Italian parliament as a
representative of the Veneto region. Gramsci was vocally anti-Mussolini,
which was a highly dangerous stance to take. In spite of his
parliamentary immunity he was arrested in 1926 by the Fascist government
under its 'emergency powers' act. At his trial, the prosecutor famously
declared that it was imperative to stop Gramsci's brain from
functioning! This manifestly did not happen: that Gramsci is known at
all today is because of the 3,000 pages of notes he compiled while in
prison, which were later smuggled out and published in four volumes as
*Quaderni del carcere (Prison Notebooks)*. The miserable conditions in
prison aggravated his already poor health, and he died in a prison
hospital halfway through his twenty-year sentence at the age of 46.
The *Prison Notebooks* cover an astonishing range of topics, including
close readings of Marx's work which had to be written entirely from
memory because communist books were not allowed in prison. His writing
was also subject to the scrutiny of the prison guards, and for this
reason he had to create an elaborate new vocabulary. Many of his new
concepts, then, are not entirely new; they are rather new words for
already existing concepts---the best-known instance of this is
[[hegemony]], which might be
considered a recasting of the traditional Marxist concept of
[[ideology]]. By the same
token, he also produced new concepts using old words---hegemony might
just as easily fall into this category. There is considerable debate in
Marxist discourse about the merits of these changes, some arguing that
they are not simply new words but genuinely new concepts, with others
taking the view that the changes are had at the price of a loss of a
sense of intellectual heritage.
Gramsci theorized the role
[[culture]] plays in politics
in a new and compelling way. He defines the state as a kind of dual
system comprising the coercive forces of political society and the
private realm of business and work or what Gramsci called [[civil society]]. With his concept of
hegemony he showed that the reason the much-anticipated revolution of
the proletariat had not yet occurred was because within the realm of
civil society the working class had come to identify their own best
interests as being one and the same as the best interests of the
bourgeoisie. The global banking crisis or 'credit crunch' of 2007--9
provided a clear example of what this looks like in practice: taxpayers'
money was used by governments in the UK, US, and elsewhere to prop up
failing banks on the basis that everyone would be worse off if they were
allowed to fail, meanwhile private mortgage holders were given little or
no relief. This rationale was largely effective because---as Gramsci
argued several decades earlier---the ruling class control the cultural
means of production, not only the media, but 'common sense' itself.
To defend against this, Gramsci argued, the proletariat needs its own
intelligentsia, in other words a standing army of what he called
[[organic intellectual]].
These are intellectuals raised up from the working classes, who in
direct contrast to the ivory-tower intellectuals do not see themselves
as separate from society. The organic intellectual shares the
experiences and understands the situation of the working classes, but
unlike them no longer feels
[[subaltern]], and for that
reason is in a position to facilitate progressive change. Gramsci
advocated 'popular' education, that is, education for everyone at every
stage of their life. His notebooks contain wonderful essays on the
political significance of popular literature and film, seeing in them
both the source of the reactionary nature of the oppressed and a promise
of change.
