[[gynocriticism]]

 A term
introduced by American
[[feminism]] literary critic
Elaine Showalter to classify critical work such as her own which focuses
exclusively on literature written by female authors. Its twofold aim is
to recover 'lost' or 'neglected' women writers and to understand in its
specificity women's construction of textual meaning. The term is not
widely used today, but the two key examples of gynocriticism, namely
Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's *The Madwoman in the Attic* (1979) and
Elaine Showalter's *A Literature of their Own* (1977), are still read
today, so the practice of gynocriticism, if not the word, is very much
alive.
