[[genre]]

 Derived ultimately
from the Latin word 'genus' (used in biology to classify subgroups of a
particular species), it is used in literary and film studies to
distinguish different types of works bearing a 'family resemblance' in
terms of composition, structure, or subject matter. In literary studies
it is used in two ways: first, on a meta-level, it is used to
distinguish between prose, poetry, and drama; second, it used to
distinguish between different types of compositions within those groups
(e.g. lyric poems, epic poems, haiku, and so on). In film studies it
tends to be used only to separate conventional narrative types (e.g.
romance, thriller, action-adventure, and so on).
