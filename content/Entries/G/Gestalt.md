[[Gestalt]]

 The German word for
'configuration', 'pattern', and 'whole' which has passed into English
because English lacks a precise equivalent. Its use in [[critical theory]] originates with
Gestalt psychology developed by Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and
Wolfgang KÃ¶hler, which explored the psychology of perception and argued
that the operational principle of perception is holistic (i.e. we see
the outline of the whole first and fill in the details in stages).
Gestalt theory passed easily into art theory, where it was used by the
influential art historian Ernst Gombrich to create a dialectic between
figure and ground.
