[[globalization]]

 A complex
process involving the worldwide diffusion of cultural products, the
streamlining of international manufacturing and trade, the
standardization of global financial markets, and the prevalence of new
media technology capable of simultaneous real-time transmission of
content everywhere in the world. Often described in terms of a
'shrinking' of the planet, the reality is in fact the opposite:
globalization is the result of the massive expansion of processes and
enterprises that were once national or at most regional in scale and
scope.
Globalization is a highly contested term. First of all, there is no
agreement that it actually exists; second, where there is agreement that
it exists, there is considerable argument about when it began; third,
where there is agreement about both its existence and its origin, there
is disagreement about whether this constitutes anything new.
Complicating matters is the fact that globalization is not 'owned' by
any single discipline and could even be said to have been simultaneously
invented by several disciplines at once. So, when an economist, a
historian, and a sociologist speak about globalization, it cannot be
taken for granted that what they have in mind is exactly the same thing.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, there is also very little agreement about
whether globalization is a good or bad thing---there is no consensus
view on either the Left or the Right.
Does globalization exist? The evidence would seem to be overwhelming.
The existence of institutions like the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the International Criminal
Court, and the United Nations, not to mention multinational corporations
like Ford®, Coca-Cola®, and Microsoft® whose businesses reach to almost
every corner of the globe, is a compelling argument for the affirmative
case. But there are those, like American anthropologist James Clifford,
who make the counter-claim that there are still hundreds of millions of
people in the poorer parts of the world completely unaware of
globalization. This view holds true if globalization is viewed strictly
as a phenomenon that one has to be conscious of or directly participate
in for it to exist. [[Beck, Ulrich]] and other [[risk society]] theorists have
shown, however, that this is not the case. For example, it is widely
accepted that climate change is a global phenomenon brought about by
human actions that affects every person on the planet whether they are
aware of it or not.
Assuming that globalization does exist, that there are enough processes
and enterprises of a global scale and scope to agree that it is a
reality, then when did it start? This is a [[periodizing hypothesis]] and as such the
answer turns on whether one can point to what amounts to
[[paradigm]] shift, a moment
when things became different in kind. [[dependency theory]] and [[world-system theory]] scholars like André
Gunder Frank and [[Wallerstein, Immanuel]], among others,
argue that what we know of as globalization today is simply
international trade by another name and that has been going on since
ancient times. On this view, globalization is simply the latest and most
extensive phase of process that has been ongoing for more than 2,000
years, and therefore nothing particularly new.
The counter argument is that the latter half of the twentieth century
has seen such seismic changes in international trade regulation,
business practice, technological advancement, geopolitical alignment,
and [[culture]] in general,
that one is compelled to take the view that there is something radically
different happening today compared to even the recent past (i.e. before
World War II). The two most obvious indicators of this change are the
financial markets and the media---the fact that the latter has taken to
almost obsessive reporting of the former is doubtless the reason for its
visibility, but its genuine global potency was made abundantly apparent
in the so-called credit crunch of 2007--9. Anyone watching a major news
service like CNN or BBC cannot help but have the impression that
globalization is a fact: almost everything is reported in terms of its
global impact (or alternatively in terms of the way the global impacts
on the local).
In cultural terms, globalization manifests itself in two ways: (i) the
global diffusion of products originally associated with a single culture
or nation (e.g., sushi, hamburgers, French fries, coffee, chocolate, and
so on are available practically everywhere in the world); (ii) a global
breaking down of local tastes, or to put it another way, a global
cosmopolitanism of taste (e.g., sushi is available everywhere because
tastes have changed to accommodate it). American sociologist [[Ritzer, George]] has tried to
characterize globalization as
[[McDonaldization]], but this
is a simplification---it assumes that globalization spread like a virus
from a single site, namely the USA, whereas in fact it is the product of
concurrent changes of the kind that only something like [[complexity theory]] would be capable of
theorizing properly.
