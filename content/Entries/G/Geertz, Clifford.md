[[Geertz, Clifford]]
(1926--2006) American cultural anthropologist. Born in San Francisco,
Geertz served in the Navy during World War II, and then studied for a BA
at Antioch College on the 'GI Bill'. This was followed by a PhD at
Harvard, for which he did extensive fieldwork in Java (in Indonesia).
Most of Geertz's fieldwork was done in Indonesia, but he also spent a
considerable period of time in Morocco. He held appointments at the
University of Chicago and at Princeton. It was Geertz's fifth book, *The Interpretation of Cultures* (1973), that brought him international
attention, and more importantly won him a large readership outside of
professional anthropological circles. He proposed a new method of
thinking about anthropological research, which he called 'thick
description', borrowing the term from British analytic philosopher
Gilbert Ryle. Describing culture as an 'acted document', Geertz argues
that the object of anthropology, i.e. what it is anthropologists
actually study, is a 'thick description' in itself, because it is a
multi-coded 'text' that is simultaneously constructed and interpreted by
the anthropologist. All human behaviour is, he argues, symbolic action,
so anthropological fieldwork consists in learning the various ways in
which symbols are manipulated in culture, without at the same time
falling into the trap of thinking these symbols are fixed or immutable.
Anthropological interpretations are thus fictions, he argues, not in the
sense of being false, but rather (as in the original meaning of the
term) made up or constructed, and therefore cannot be schematized. He
developed this thesis further in the subsequent work *Local Knowledge*
(1983). Geertz's method chimed well with the shift toward
[[relativism]] and
[[pragmatism]] which
[[postmodernism]] heralded
and his work was enormously influential in a wide variety of fields,
notably literary studies and [[Cultural Studies]]. [[New Historicism]]'s leading
scholar [[Greenblatt, Stephen]] has openly
acknowledged a theoretical debt to Geertz. In the latter part of his
career, Geertz's work took a more biographical and ultimately
autobiographical turn: first, he wrote a short book on the lives of four
key anthropologists, *Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author*
(1988), then a book about his own life in the field, *After the Fact:
Two Countries, Four Decades, One Anthropologist* (1995).
