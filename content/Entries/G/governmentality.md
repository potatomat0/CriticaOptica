[[governmentality]]
**(*gouvernementalité*)** [[Foucault, Michel]]'s word for the
set of assumptions underpinning a particular mode of government. In
*Precarious Life* (2004), Judith Butler defines governmentality as a
mode of power focused on the production, control, and regulation of
bodies and persons. It operates through bureaucracies and institutions
like the police and the law, but it can also be found at work in
apparently non-regulated spaces of [[everyday life]] as well. It is diffuse,
tactical rather than strategic, and impossible to trace to a single
source or origin. Studying it amounts to a deciphering of its logic.
Foucault coined this term in the course of his lectures on security,
territory, and population and suggested that where before he had spoken
of [[biopower]], this was
what he had in fact meant. Although the words are obviously related and
share a common point of origin, they are nonetheless distinct:
governmentality defines a general problematic, while biopower refers to
a specific historical example. In a separately published lecture from
the aforementioned series from 1977--8 entitled 'Governmentality',
Foucault explains that he means three things by this term: (i) the
ensemble of institutions and procedures that enable the exercise of a
very specific type of power; (ii) the tendency that has over time led to
the predominance of a specific model of power (i.e. biopower); and (iii)
the processes by which previous models of power came to be
governmentalized. In Foucault's view, what he terms 'government' (by
which he means something approximating bureaucracy, though he has in
mind something rather more active than that) has basically supplanted
the state and the sovereign. Governmentality also implies something like
the old sociological notion of 'mentality', meaning a way of thinking as
much as a set of practices. Perhaps most importantly, governmentality
implies the passing of a certain kind of sovereignty, which in everyday
parlance we think of as 'top-down', whereby a single powerful figure
such as a king or president is able to exert their will.
