[[grand narrative]] 

**(*grand récit*)** [[Lyotard, Jean-François]]

's term for ideas,
concepts, notions, or beliefs which can function to legitimate certain
social actions and practices. For instance, the notion of revolution,
since the French Revolution, has served to legitimate large-scale
programmes of social change. Similarly, the notion of
[[Enlightenment]] has served
to legitimate a movement toward secular reason. Such grand narratives no
longer function, according to Lyotard who defines the
[[postmodern]] age as being
characterized by incredulity towards all grand narratives. Several
critics have argued that it is too early to say that all grand
narratives have become defunct.
[[Marxism]] (it is thought by
many) still retains its power to give social life coherence and meaning.
In Anglo-American [[Cultural Studies]], grand narrative has
been interpreted to mean any form of overarching
[[ideology]], which it then
codes as oppressive.
