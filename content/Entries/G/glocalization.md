[[glocalization]]

 A neologism
conflating the terms 'global' and 'local' to express the paradoxical
manner in which processes of
[[globalization]], which seem
to erode the very possibility of the local, in fact demand an
intensified attention to it. Glocalization highlights the
inextricability of the two views of the world: global and local. Global
processes, such as the movement of international finance flows, have a
local effect, and vice versa, as the 'credit crunch' of 2007--9
demonstrated---failing mortgages in America almost brought down the
entire global financial sector.
Glocalization was first used by Manfred Lange to describe the goal of
the 1989 Global Change exhibition he curated in Bonn, which was to show
the interconnection between the different levels of perception---local,
regional, and global. In academic circles it was popularized by British
sociologists Roland Robertson and [[Bauman, Zygmunt]]. The relation
between the global and the local has also been of great concern to
[[Postcolonial Studies]],
particularly the critics [[Appadurai, Arjun]], [[Bhabha, Homi]], Arif Dirlik, and
